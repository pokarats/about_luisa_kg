i hope you are well
my artwork for acute art london will be online as well on friday.
i am not able to be there from the opening but
thank you for the invitation, i am looking forward the exhibition and the dinner.that is great, a small group is good to talk about things and
but i am sure we can do that
petra invites me to show at her art cologne booth in november, it would be great if you could talk about the conditions.
great that you getting in touch museum susch if you need anything from me let me know.
on your website i found out that there is a download on the milgaming web portal, but i could find it.
the 20th sound great, i am looking forward to meet you in bonn and hear more about your shows, sounds interesting.
especially since these artificial persons will have a different form of existence based on me.
now i am working on this futher to transfer it into the exhibitionspace as well and try to find places to realise it again in the public.
, i would bring the catalogue, and talk about borders of photography, just short
i am an artist from germany, who hat the great chance to visit your institute, in june this year.
johann cancelled the appointment tomorrow, there are some problems in his gallery came up during the last days, so we will see whats happening.
and she thinks that the new series of body parts which i will do in the next weeks would fit perfectly for the collection.
yes i am available between 1 and 3 and 4 till 6 berlin time would that fit for you all right, will be there at 2.
that is so nice to hear.
can you sent me the room plan of the gallery, i would like to start thinking about the exhibition.
i hope you understand my problem with this situation.
the show in hamburg is eventually moved to february, we are not sure jet, i let you know when this is safe.
yesterday i got the very spontaneous invitation of christine k√∂nig gallery in vienna not johann but
i just sented some images via whatsapp, sorry they just came yesterday, the production is quite intense but really good and we are nearly at the end of the hardware, all good in time and very close on the details and measurements
are you sending the equipment directly to the museum and do i have to know anything for the installation.
here are the answers.
the piece i am thinking about is related to my latest series of photographs called gliedermenschen.
what i think was ok, that was a small show and under the recent situation
the photo material was the material peggy weil advised me to use for the walls, we could use another kind of paper, i will ask my printer about the possibilities and costs.
the rest of the room should be as neutral as possible, because i wanted to concentrate on the conversation not on the outside, it is not about affects.
the interview we could do perhaps per phone, better.
so i would connect you with my assistant as well who will be organising everything next year, if this is ok for you.
the other big historical pieces, is a bit slower we are still searching for a place
here are some points how the series fit into a lager context, that is just for you nothing to quote or to print.
i will be in london from the 15th to the 17th if we are thinking about doing an interview or something i could come by.
i recently came back from israel which was amazing and now i am on holiday in spain, wonderful time.
perhaps the best would be to talk on the phone the next days, to get to know each other a bit
i am starting now programming the ai
i hope you had a great time in venice, it was so nice there.
my summer was great, yes israel was amazing, such an inspiring place
but we are in contact
i am very looking forward seeing you and
now i am waning for the museums in germany to open again, actually the opening would be today, now i hope it will be open soon.
it is perfect when you make a press package.
now i wonder if it would be interesting to transfer the piece also in ar or vor.
during some researches i found your paper about the e-dermins perceives touch and pain.
i was very intensively busy with my portrait project, which means, i prepared the ai with answering questions about myself, personal life, art, and working life.
with gursky it seems to be a little bit difficult.
phase two will be the production; i hope this will be the easiest part.
now i am planning the first shows of the piece for next year and already have an institutional show in germany save in april, afterwards italy and two shows in switzerland coming up as in london for that piece.
the table is not a glass table it is out of linoleum
perhaps we have some time than for a nice dinner or so.
johanna and i are trying to come to the opening but we are quite spontaneous, as we didnt booked any hotels until now.
next week i am completely free so let me know when it is good for you.
at the same time i opened a side specific project in bonn at a underground station.
i am fine with both.
the realization is progressing astonishingly fast and admittedly it makes me a little bit sick to my stomach, because there are some legal things to be clarified.
is was really funny :
, what do you think https:
it would be great if you have some ideas where to show the piece so recently, perhaps also giovanni got some ideas for london
i will be in new york from 3rd to 8th of march, quite spontaneously and would be great to meet him.
do you have all images or shall i send them all to you
i am moving to los angeles next month for the fellowship of villa aurora but will come back in may anyway for some days.
great i talked to georg yesterday, nice that he can come as well.
especially the emotional and the question of how i deal with artificiality in my life is one that i would like to bring to the fore here, alongside questions of author theory and institutional critique.
