let me know when you are around, im in basel during the whole art basel week.
to be part of their show for the 30 anniversary of the gallery.
i made this series quite connected to my series called avatars and the series you saw at gladstone.
until now i always installed the piece in a horizontal row, just once in a presentation in france
so these photos are you for you to get an impression what will be happening ;
i like your project very much
thank you, that is a great honour for me of course i agree with the design
that sounds wonderful ill keep you posted when i will be landed but 7 should work out fine.
perhaps some of these below i think they could work.
one of our strongest experience is pain, physically and mentally.
it was very inspiring and
here are some new visual examples from china :
below you can find some images of the transformationschnitt, the poison gas installation as a new work i am now working on realizing in germany in the beginning of 2021.
i am free for the whole day, i am so excited
do you need some kind of guarantee that i just use it for this art piece thank you so much for your support that is really great, to me this way of thinking about the body and pain is very important for my work.
here are some impressions of the show.
exactly in march the puppet will already be here in germany, or better 3 of them will be here than.
from that point, i started to transfer these moulds in photography as well, because i noticed that these empty bodies, the negative space become a positive space by using the iphone to make pictures of them.
can we talk tomorrow i am sitting in a train since two hours, it stops because of a police operation ....
but photos are ready, so even if it will not happen, we have the photos
were i am now.
here are the plans, i marked in the second one were the pieces will be.
my idea is to create surrounding
des tänzers weg der seele, friday 15 september at wentrup gallery in berlin.
if that is not possible, what would cost a baby doll
here is my list for the dinner, there are a lot of people, i am sure they wont come all to the opening, but i think it is good to invite them and to start the contact with, some of their collectors following my work since the beginning and are buying a lot.
would be great to meet, we will see.
i hope you had some great days in düsseldorf and wuppertal.
my question about the date of the opening
through my research i notices your company and i am very impressed about the possibilities and the way of thinking behind your products and f cause the perfections of your dolls is amazing.
it was such a great time in israel, i already booked to come back in october.
and you have a great summer.
here everything is good, focusing on studio work and some research.
great, of course i am around, i would love to see you in berlin, let me know when you have time i am not busy except of the opening.
but it went all good
i thought about having some footage of the installation of the show in hannover as well, in the studio it is more or less sitting on the computer
the opening is on the 14th in our installations time, so we have to celebrate it in milano haha
i am so looking forward the show i just arranged the production of the pieces, so they will be ready by the end of april and will be in my studio.
the head is modelled and mechanised separately in order to make facial expressions and gestures as real as possible.
through my research i found your company and i very impressed by the work you are doing.
a series of photographs showing the explosive ordnance sunk into the dethlingen pond after the second world war, exposed in 2019.
currently im still looking for financial support, the art foundation nrw would like to support the project and also advance the implementation for next year.
i am an artist from düsseldorf and a good friend of claudia and thomas from konrad fischer.
so you can choose which one we want to use.
my opening in berlin was wonderful really great time over there.
and you had a wonderful summer.
here i have one question, as the group is so small, do you want me to print the pieces so that we can just hang around quite casual and talk about things or shall i make a digital portfolio after that i will talk about how to find ideas and inspiration.
i think they are motivated and really interested in the production, but i think it would be good to follow both ways right now.
through my research i found the website of your company and was impressed of the perfection of production.
when in may would the conference be.
if you are free at the friday evening of the opening, be very invited to the opening and dinner afterwards invite will come next week
on this point we have to change to texts.
and after this show i will have a small show during the architecture biennale in venice, so crazy may but good may as well ;
in the studio its been going on a lot, new works are coming up, you i like to tell you a little bit, they are not really easy
and i will come back in february; i am so looking forward to.
you are not there, are you if you are, we could meet for a coffee, i will be around till thursday.
the bots are asking questions and wait for an answer of the human friend which doesnt make sense in this version.
and shall we talk about the new piece the next days could be interesting to show that as well in norway at the onstad triennale …
totally ok i think.
i just wonder if you have any two-piece mould you dont need any more for the production.
great if you can contact the doctor, that would be amazing.
it would be great to meet you and talk to you.
through my research i found your website and i am very fascinated by the perfection of your dolls and the topic you are dealing with.
i will be in new york for the armory show from the 4th till the 8th of march and will definitely come to the gallery to see the shows, would be nice to see you over there.
and now i am very sure that the piece works out.
so i could stop by in new york then.
and now i am quite happy and a little bit relaxed
i am quite happy with the installation.
here are the answers hope they are ok, let me know if you need something else or more, always here to support our exhibition and the gallery i dont have any photos from düsseldorf jet, i wills for them today.
i think the best would be to present the piece the first time in an institutional context and afterwards in the gallery and fair context.
for the content of the piece, i think i am using media in a different way; i didnt want to do a vr piece
i am sure about he is super nice.
great, just let me know if you need me on berlin or in london, both is always fun to go
and the last one will be two new piece related to the way of working and dealing with the moulds, this is the newest pieces, so it is not titled yet but will be during the next days, it is a bronze mould of and reborn baby.
if you give me the exact dominions of the walls that would be amazing.
sorry to bother you again
the sculptures with photographies called mork some of the gliedermensch and avatar examples are below and two mirrors also animation below.
i am recently preparing my stay in los angeles for the next three months and really looking forward to i just saw this residency which sound really interesting and was wondering if you have a contact to them and can put a good word in for me :
i didt hear something from irene.
a form that will act differently, think and experience other things.
the show could be more interesting
but i think they have to be done.
can i put you in contact
i dont know of you know cassina projects they asked me just some days ago to do a show next year at there place
it is next to beyerle foundation.
here are some words about the series, but can you please tell the art forum, no quotes of mine, that would be cool.
i would be very happy to see you there, and i am except of wednesday the whole week in berlin perhaps you are around as well so we can meet for a coffee.
it would be great to start thinking about that topic form that point on or eventually take some very abstract photos at this company, nothing were you really can see something.
i hope you are well, i will be in london at the 17th of december, if you are around we could talk about the piece than
were you can meet one of these gliedermenschen and can talk to them.
the new sculptures will be produced next month but here are some sketches.
and now we are talking about showing it at serpentine in london.
i cannot not answer
the heads have a connection to bernd and hillas bechers topographies or to hans-peter feldmanns way of collecting images, so more or less the conceptual way dealing with photography, but transformed into today.
i am coming at the 6th and will stay till the 18th so the reception and artist talk is great for me
thank you for the great evening and the invitation to that.
at the moment i am working on different things, it is a lot but everything are good things and fun to work and think about.
but then i will basically focused on the way of production of bernd an hilla becher,then how they teach, how the düsseldorf school came up, what kind of production do we see and how do they work and how they find their inspiration.
perhaps you find time to have a look.
the week was great, really good opening we can catch up tomorrow anytime or on thursday, what would be better for you

i would love to invite you to my next exhibition opening next week in riehen near basel and next to beyerle foundation at the kunstraum riehen.

just talked with acute, of course we can show the piece if we want to.
i would love to stay in contact.

though an random function you never know when it is lying and when it is the thought.
so transport can be anytime
the bars and walls are options to show not list in you, depending on the space and combination.

yes i have everything
i would love to desk with the prediction of production in these new pieces.
i hope you are well

which can conduct standardized conversation, also watch a movie with his opposite and talk about it, for example.
at the opening he was ill
next week on wednesday my new exhibition project by the digitale kunsthalle of the tv channel zdf will be online.
we are just thinking about coming to gent on friday eventually, we let you know.
it would be great to meet you and talk to you.
i am looking forward hearing from you.
i am on my way to hannover again the german tv channel zdf builds a digital museum and invited me to show my exhibition of the sprengel museum in this museum as well, it is a completely different ways to think about the pieces we will see what comes out of it.
i am an artist from germany.
attached you can find my portfolio.
we only work with china if this is possible otherwise i will find a way with the german company
and i am only involved in artistic decisions and tell them what i want : very computable.
so i have to plan a little bit how many of them are free at the time of the festival.
i hope you are well.
can you already sent me the piece i have to go to brussels on sunday and after that to hanover to install the show on tuesday, so i wont be at the computer the next week.
i am now back in la working on some new projects and enjoying the sun over here.
i hope you are well.
tomorrow there is a vip breakfast in my exhibition at the kunstraum riehen next to the beyeler foundation, i am very spontaneously allowed to invite people by myself, so i would love to invite you to this breakfast at 9:30.
i got this inquiry; do you want to contact the guy
of course we can all meet in cologne
can i ask you to connect me to the curator of the lacma and of the museum in santa barbara that would be so great to meet them when i am back in l.a.
let me know which ones you would like to produce, so we can ask conzen and grieger.
title of the piece is aporias.
i hope it is ok that i contact you.
great, we can also do a skype meeting with my lawyer if you want.
berlin was amazing, a lot but great.
conversations she has when she is in the world can form and change her, so that she, like people, changes with and absorbs the influences of the world.
let me know, when it is good for you to meet
i would love to bring my new catalogue to the gallery.
i need just a contract between us, so if we can make that till thursday that would be great
as i work a lot about human interaction and the question what about humanity nowadays and how technology is connected to our lifes.
how that changes me, it is as if the dolls lead other lives for me.
do you have a final list of artist also being part of the exhibition
thank you for questioning me, sounds fun i would love to come on the 26th.
so i can return to frankfurt for the conference, that would be perfect.
the avatars are 120 cm x 90 cm x 4cm and wrapped in bubble wrap as well.
here everything is great, there were some gallery changes during the last month, so i am not working with wentrup gallery anymore and started working with cassina projects in milan, were now my first show is one view.
my plan it to transform this mould into a bronze, to also reflect the perfection of this dolls and the production.
i need a possibility to print amine offered the possibility to print at his office junior needs to print as well but just 4a format.
my works are dealt with the future of human body, in terms of technical and medical progress and emotions as the question of relationships and love.
and i am selected for the prize for photography of alison and peter klein foundation, the opening is on the same day.
düsseldorf was nice, how was it for you, went everything well
i am recently very busy with some shows coming up the next two weeks, but afterwards i will sent you an image.
i really want to go there, really great chance.
if i have the dates i can arrange my flights.
what do you think, would that possible
here are some impressions of the show, as promised.
i had this question if a conversation with a bot is a real conversation, because it isnt related to another human anymore, an ai generate its answers by itself, and is not connected to a person who is controlling it after setting it up.
the german tv channel zdf is planning to show my exhibition at the sprengel museum in their digital kunsthalle and it is possible to show vr-pieces and also the mobile version.
and 27.3 is an opening at kunstpalast düsseldorf, an exhibition on düsseldorf photography, 50 artists 4 generations.
great would be if i could get the mould of the back.
so very exciting times right now.
, i am so exhibited what will happen.
the step to think about a robotic and artificial intelligent counterpart was quite small.
i would love to do the piece together.
in my current exhibition in berlin, the emotional negotiation of these empty bodies in particular has continued for me.
so we are planning a dinner during the next weeks, will be fun
let me know when its good for you to talk, looking forward speaking with you.
can i share the invitation already
can i hand it to you tomorrow.
perhaps i can see it on the computer
