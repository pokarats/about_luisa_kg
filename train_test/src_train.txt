radicalization is apparent in further photographic works.
in her work, clement does not fall for the simple pictorial rhetoric of explicitly representing real facts.

we should have a voice and spirit that brings cause and effect in a different context then the one of knowledge and power.
durants paralel of this symbolic-historian comparison follows the idea of simpson to not only remember the students who were killed at kent state during the vietnam protest, but also touches the many statements regarding the entropy of the 1960s and 70s, when the world was confronted with change and durant includes sound, that is music, in his wood shed sculpture.

i find it extraordinary that louisa clement, whose work methods of photographical observation of her surroundings and quotidian always had a constant, with this radical sculptural statement phrases a new view, a haptic dimension in the virtual space of possibility that is everyday warfare.
this leads me to the second land art artist robert smithson and his sucessor sam durant, who at the same time developed his theory of entropy, of sites and non-sites, crystalline forms, mirrors, soil and trees etc.

what we see and hear is the shocking rigidity of an entropic process.
and in the delicate pastel shades that reveal not only the artists sensitivity to color but also how clements development started in painting before moving on to photography.
the apparent contradiction between presence and absence is also evident at another level in photographs of objects derived from warfare, or at any rate the use of force, as, for instance, in the series weapon 2017.
the starting point was the failed attempt to create a biometrically correct passport photo then there arose questions like when do i fit the standardization that this kind of photo demands, and when dont i, what does that sort of fitting actually mean, and what has that got to do with society in the course of this clash of meanings, clement noticed the faceless mannequin heads, which she ultimately portrayed with the smartphone camera.
in looking at the subsequent works, it is important to keep in mind that clement essentially operates in thematic groups or series of works.
the absence of weapons in the storage modules photographed, along with the absence of the physical contents of the gun cases, nevertheless has a drastic effect, both via the aestheticism of the obscene glossy displays and via the inherent associations of those weapons potential uses.
what upon first glance is a sober arrangement of broken glass stones, discloses a horrible secret once the material and context is laid bare.

in its extreme forms, or in visionary concepts, the classical human–machine opposition has been morphed into a hybrid form that focuses attention on the question of where humanitys borders lie.
however, this provides no feedback, and it is irrelevant whether or not the entrant knows that their touch is ineffective, because the artist is primarily concerned with the increasing discrepancy between the actions of real bodies i.e., individuals in a real world—whatever is meant by that—and the impact of the actions of
the first victims had arrived alive, but many who were exposed to the gas for a longer period of time did not make it that far and were brought to the hospital after they had perished.
is her explicit artistic purpose to raise questions about the interpersonal and about contemporary political topics in her work5 after radicalizing deindividualized heads to monochrome surfaces in the portrait series in 2015—in the form of city-light advertisement placards following the generally accepted cmyk color model cyan, magenta, yellow, and black—and thus quitting the photographic medium as narrowly defined,
in this confrontation with the moving hand, the figures—all at once seemingly lifeless—are slowly, now and then erotically, grasped and fondled.

the invasion of reality into the imaginary does not happen in our art spaces, but radically politically in our immediate surroundings.

the walls of the room are completely covered with a high-tech fabric, a so-called e-dermis.
in this analysis of individual groups of photographic works, i shall seek to show how the artist has exhausted a limited, medium-specific concept of the two-dimensional photograph, and at times transformed it, and how this is the almost inevitable upshot of the contemporary sociopolitical questioning that her approach involves.

clement addresses this phenomenon impressively in her new work schmerzraum space of distress, 2019, fig.
one could take them for precious relics of some exotic culture, because of the materials unusual look and because the multitude of pieces lie in no particular conjunction with one another, and so give no clue to the possible purpose of the original solid mass.
in recent years, though, interventions in the human body by technology and medicine have taken on a new quality, and as a result the question of the boundaries of the human has acquired an alarming prominence.
the mannequin heads, with their avatar-like quality and absence meaning presence stand for a social development that at least partly eliminates physical appearance as the most immanent metaphor for what is human.
while in the 1980s the discussion about the panel painting dominated the photographic discourse, today it is about the circulation of the images or photos themselves.
and fracture is not in the strictest sense a series, in that its pictorial organization is not focused on the central vertical axis, for the examination of various details brings in changing groupings, some of them seemingly ornamental.
