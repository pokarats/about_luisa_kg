for me it is important that the pieces are insured and we need to do something like a contract if that is ok for you, about the shipping back and forth and how long the pieces will stay with you.
so far a relatively ambitious project where the technology must be very precise.
the image caption should say: avatar , 2016, 116 cm x 86 cm, inkjetprint and at the card could be important the courtesy which is me and sprüth magers.
my name is louisa clement, i am an artist from germany; my work is dealing with communication and emotion in our age.
when in may would the conference be.
great, thank you looking forward coming to frankfurt
it would be great if you could connect me to your friend at the die foundation, i will be in new york in november, perhaps already in august so would be great if he is interested in the poison piece.
of course lots of things to see but also enough time to work which is really great to have this combination working out so well…
perhaps we can meet on thursday or friday this week, i am till wednesday in paris, today is the opening of my show here and on saturday i am going to munich for a week to work on a project for next year.
my first point for the piece i am planning now was a theory of some futuristics, they are dealing with the these
thank you for the information, that is very helpful to think about what to do.
im looking forward the jahresgaben weekend, will be fun
from this point, however, i thought that an abstract counterpart is still relatively easy to deal with, for me a personal depth was missing, what exactly does it do to you when you copy a person technologically
the plan is to meet one of them in a virtual space.
maybe it would be the easiest if we meet online, via zoom or skype, for example and talked about the project i am sure clemens has already told you a lot, but maybe you have some questions, that i would be happy to answer.
until now it is not really clear what this company is doing, but google invested ca 750 million dollar in that project.
i will be in amsterdam next wednesday and want to visit the huis marseille of course.
for me it is important that the students always can ask question or tell what they see or what they dont like for example, do you have anything what is missing for you or something we should leave out
great to read that, thank you
it was a pleasure to meet you at the party of white cube, yesterday.
i hope you all are very well.
concrete represents the defining building material of the 20th century, which stands for modernity and efficiency, but also for war, violence and security.
yes i think now we are on the right person
here are all mirrors, there are 19 different but not produced, the pink one with the golden frame is sold out but the others are still there.
how are your plans with the exhibition, i know that is a bit difficult right now, but i think it would be good to have them in berlin as well.
i hope you are good
is it possible to work with beamers and can i work with the photo-tex all over the wall i worked on a new installation which is actually photo based about avatars whochcould fit perfectly.
i let you know when i am in london for acute the next time.
it would be amazing to get at least a little information what they are doing.
i am actually focusing on the philosophical discussion and the question what the changes of technique and upgrades of the human body does in terms of society and ethic skills.
two of them will be in the exhibition and the third one should be open the exhibition directly in the entrance of the museum i dont have plans for this space.
i am quite bad putting my self in the context.
in terms of photography i am thinking about anonymity and privacy.
perfect than i will order the two frames and conzen can bring them both to bonn, easy ;
i can sent you one of those i hope i meet you in person next time in new york or europe.
so one could be aporias
here are the cost of the table and seats for the piece.
sound interesting the question how aporias is programmed
do you have time for a call today
i hope you are well.
i am not in la, i am living in germany but perhaps we can skype
i am very happy that you like the avatar series so much.
all my best to you for the new year.
, it is really a good time i have to say head is exploding of ideas, that makes super happy.
the way the bots look like is related to a photographic series i did in 2017, called gliedermenschen which is again related to heinrich von kleists on the marionette theatre where he is dealing with the marionette and the mechanist, and the relationship between both.
can you sent me some invitations when they are printed
if we work with the chinese company i would say we order one doll for the show and the others when we have buyers.
if you have any further questions other comments please let me know.
i am an artist from germany, in my work i am dealing with the human body, its borders, and identity nowadays.
, there is just the feeling, that something will come out, to i follow that.
they are planning the show the piece on three different places in the museum, so is it possible to get the equipment for the installations and is there anything they have to know before, like sharing the equipment or something else yes one headset per table ist perfect, the exhibition will end in juli.
if vivi would help with the language could be good, i am pretty sure the prices the english company shares are far too high, so it would be good to have the real numbers and terminus of timeline.
but perhaps ellis gut another idea how to present the work online
i have a question, i will have my first exhibition at konrad fischer gallery düsseldorf in january next year, yesterday i talked to thomas and we decided that it would be great if we would have a text about the pieces i am showing.
and i just looked up the chianti foundation in texas which looks really interesting to me.
recently i have one project, i would like to ask you if you have any advice or an idea who could support this kind of project or is interested in, as i know it is a very big project
great choice, i am very happy that you are interested in the work, i talked to the gallery i am working with and the heads you want are all available and of course framed.
, i am sending the last files right now to julia.
i am sorry, but that is not how you work together.
i thinking about come to new york after may, i will let you know when i know for sure.
i will sent pictures from berlin, for new york, everything sounds really great thank you a lot.
it was a great day yesterday, thank you for that.
i will be in venice from the 7th until the 10th.
all right, then lets show the piece.
what would be better for you
it would just the back half of the mould
