You can even create [composite indexes](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss/wiki/Faiss-indexes-(composite)). Faiss handles collections of vectors of a fixed dimensionality d, typically a few 10s to 100s.\n",

That Louisa Clement appeals to the conceptual art, is especially clear regarding her work in completed series.\",\n",
