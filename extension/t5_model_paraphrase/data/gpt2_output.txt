Great, that would be really cool. The Avatar series is based on my latest work: On the one hand, on the VR work of Hans Bellmer and Bruce Nauman, two self-portrait series that use the iPhone to imagerically gather information about human interaction in the real world. On the other hand, the dystopian genre-western genre-western, where the iPhone is connected to the Internet, is routinely used to gather information on the human body and its interaction. I would love to stay in contact. Attached you can find my portfolio. The series heads got 55 images per panel, each of them dealing with a different aspect of the human body. From there, the series heads can be downloaded for individual presentation or as part of a larger exhibition.
For me, the most intense exploration of the human body leads me to sculptures of sex doll shells I made. I was interested in the line between imagination and reality, between the two. line between two or more individuals is blurred in the mass production of these 'empty' bodies. I needed something closely related to the human body yet that is also abstract and far removed from it. I would love to invite you to my next solo show. The opening is at the 19th of may, but the show will be on till the 21st. I would love to show you the new pieces. The series heads got 55 pieces. the series is shown before at the Kunsthalle Emden and the Kunstmuseum Rathingen in Germany. The heads got 55 pieces.
For me, the most intense exploration comes when I meet new people and the chance encounters of real people. The German TV Channel ZDF is planning to show my exhibition 'Amerikaner Essen' next week at the Sprengel Museum in their digital Kunsthalle and it is possible to show VR-pieces and also the mobile version. They want to reduce the show of the Museum a little bit, they want to have only four rooms. I would love to invite you to my next solo show and first in Switzerland. The show will open next week but will be on during Art Basel as well. I would love to show you the new pieces. The German government invites me to come to Washington with them for a celebration of the German year in America. This will be 3-4th October.
What are you working on now?I am working on a virtual reality piece with a new company in London called acute art, Daniel Birnbaum is the director, the piece will be shown first time in January at my first solo show at the Sprengel Museum and will afterwards shown in the Ludwig forum in Aachen where I will add a new installation as well called Rexport. The German TV Channel ZDF is planning to show my exhibition at the Sprengel Museum in their digital Kunsthalle and it is possible to show VR-pieces and also the mobile version. They want to reduce the show of the Museum a little bit, they want to have only four rooms.
I am in Berlin during Art Basel, from the beginning to the end of the 1990s. Perhaps you can make it to see the exhibition. The mannequins are made of 100% water-tight, 100% breathable polyethylene. I am working on a virtual reality piece with a new company in London called acute art, Daniel Birnbaum is the director, the piece will be shown first time in January at my first solo show at the Sprengel Museum and will afterwards shown in the Ludwig forum in Aachen but also in the Kunstmusuem in Bonn and now we are talking about showing it at Serpentine in London. The mannequins are not tracking. they are tracking.
I am sometimes dealing with the human body and AI a lot. For this installation you need not only the floorplan, as well with the chairs, as well the shelves, which are linoleum-like as well. I installed them completely free of cost in the studio and afterwards they are framed in wood. For the viewer the experience of the piece is unique, because the moving pieces are completely abstracted and rendered in the virtual world. The viewer is led to believe that for every moving individual ’individual piece of the ’work’, there is at least one ’digital’ counterpart. I would love to invite you to my next solo show. The show will open next week but will be on during Art Basel as well. I would love to show you the new pieces. The series heads got 55 pieces, each with 50 pieces.
I am working mostly with mannequins, doll heads, stadiums, and more. I am in Tel Aviv from the 21.-28.7. The Avatar series plays with the tension between their artificiality and their otherwise human postures. Clement’s approach is reminiscent of Georg Herold’s “realism” (physicality aside), in which individuals are portrayed as living beings in a posthuman, incorporeally arranged world. Clement reflects on the artist’s approach by focusing on the joints and joints themselves. I am so looking forward going to Israel again. Let me know when you're coming to see the show of Herold, you can always stay here! The piece I am thinking about is related to my latest series of photographs called 'gliedermenschen'.

For the show we got the sculpture and photo pieces in my studio, the new series called 'gliedermenschen'. the series heads got 55 pieces. the series is shown before on the 21st and 22nd at Konrad Fischer Gallery in Duesseldorf. I am so looking forward going to Israel again.
i am around on Thursday as well so i have a small exhibition at the Sprengel museum Hannover (29.1 opening) and a video production on Saturday as well. The title of the exhibition is a bit vague, but Clement’s sculpture sets out in part the question of a contemporary relationship between two worlds: one virtual and one real. What is the relationship between virtual and real? What is the relationship between man and machine? What are the social consequences of acting differently? What are the social consequences of acting differently? What are the political consequences of acting differently? What are the costs of living differently? These are questions that Clement refers to in her work.
i am around on Thursday as well so i have time for a coffee and a little history class then. The piece I am thinking about is related to your work called 'disruption'. do you have a special title for that and does this artist need to work with this kind of abstraction? The title refers to a special area in the city where you cannot walk or train without being linked to landmarks. This is a little bit guesswork as I am not sure which way the train will take you, but from my knowledge the line between train station and underground is always the same. The piece I am thinking about is related to my latest series of photographs called 'heads'.
i am around on Thursday as well so i have a little time then. The piece I am thinking about is related to your work called avatars. do you have a special name for this art form and does this artistic work need to be more like an avatar for me in that it displays more and more information about me? I am pretty sure showing AI communicative behavior is a little bit weird because you can ask me questions and I will tell you more about my work, so it is closer to home. The piece I am thinking about is related to my latest series of photographs called 'gliedermenschen'. my idea is to create surrounding were you can meet one of these 'gliedermenschen' and can talk to them.
I am in the question of the borders of human relationships and the question of an open, yet connected, market. I am working mostly with mannequins for two reasons. First because the questions I am dealing with are general rather than personalized. The other reason I am working with mannequins is that I am interested in avatars, as the digital identity of a human being. To visualize the interaction between avatars, I needed something closely related to the human body yet that is also abstract and far removed from it. i am thinking about the idea of a room covered with a high-tech fabric. I will show some of the pieces, first on the first floor, then on the third floor. The room will have a computer connected to it, so you can interact with it and talk to it. The series heads got 55 pieces.
i am thinking about the possibility to visit aporias and just take a look at their architecture. do you need to know more about the antechamber or do you need to know more about the pieces? do you need to know more about the production line and the website? The piece I am thinking about is related to my latest series of photographs called 'gliedermenschen'. my idea is to create surrounding were you can meet one of these 'gliedermenschen' and can talk to them. The piece I am thinking about is related to my latest series of photographs called auroras. the series are set during the summer months in Germany and the US. the heads of the mannequins are arranged so that you can meet one of them to talk to them.
For me, the biggest influence is Oskar Schlemmer, the German philosopher and artist best known for his theories of the human body and human communication. I would love to invite you to my next solo show and first in Switzerland. The show will open next week but will be on during Art Basel as well. I would love to show you the new pieces. The series heads got 55 pieces, each with its own special look and feel. I would love to invite you to my next solo show and first in Switzerland. The show will open next week but will be on during Art Basel as well. I would love to show you the new pieces. The series heads got 55 pieces, each with its own special look and feel.
I am now working on a contract with a company to make art during the next months, so i won't be able to come to New York until the end of May, so i will go to Brussels then. In the end, I’m still trying to find my way as an artist, trying to find new questions about the world I am creating for and of myself. The Avatar series plays with the tension between their artificiality and their otherwise human postures. Clement’s approach is particularly acute, reminding us of the seductive beauty of heads and the seductive power of the lumps of fabric wearers wear.
The piece I am showing is a hybrid between a true photograph and a VR piece. The “heads“ will be completely covered with an AI based prosthesis. “I will train it like a real person and afterwards it will be tested and I will show it to you. The piece I am showing is based on my latest work. The concept is to create a space station communicative robotic sex doll that can be programmed to please and love me. I want to ask you if you want to work with me and if it would be possible to work with prostheses. I am so looking forward going to Israel again.
I would love to invite you to my next solo show and first in Switzerland. The opening is at the 19th of may, but the show will be on till the 21st. The piece I am thinking about is related to my latest series of photographs called 'gliedermenschen'. my idea is to create surrounding were you can meet one of these 'gliedermenschen' and can talk to them.
To think in a different way every day. I would love to invite you to my next solo show and first in Switzerland. The opening is at the 19th of September. Perhaps you are around during this time as well. I would love to show you the new piece The piece I am showing is a self-portrait. I think this is one of the most challenging artistic artistic questions we face. We must decide how we want to express and use art in our society at the same time. The piece I am showing is based on my latest work. The concept is to create a space where you can meet one of my “masses“ and interact with them. the body is a 3D printed TPE (Transparency Optics Projection Projection) and the arms/elbows are 3D printed using my Photo-realistic 3D printed body.
To me it is important to concentrate on the questions of what is real knowledge and what is not. What is the relevance of what we know and how we use it in our daily lives. What is the impact of our actions and ideas on the world? What are the social consequences of our actions? These are the questions I was working on during the week. Irene Cassina from Cassina Projects in New York gave me the advice to contact you. I am an artist from Duesseldorf and a good friend of Claudia and Thomas from Konrad Fischer. I am in Tel Aviv this week, perhaps you are around. Tel Aviv is a little bit easier to go to Herold but perhaps you are around. Irene Cassina from Cassina Projects in New York gave me the advice to contact you.
Actually I didn't see that coming, actually I didn't see it coming until now. I was in Switzerland for three days and saw the train coming back again. I am so happy with the show Miciah made and that he invited me, it looks really great and is amazing. The piece I am thinking about is related to my latest series of photographs called 'gliedermenschen'. my idea is to create surrounding were you can meet one of these 'gliedermenschen' and can talk to them.
i am thinking about a virtual reality piece, perhaps you have some good advice to get an impression of an artificial being, i would be very interested to learn more about her. The piece I am thinking about is related to my latest series of photographs called 'gliedermenschen'. the series are about splitting off and approaching one's own person in the image you see through the lens. the points of the border are not representing real borders, they are placeholders for digital communication and interaction. The piece I am thinking about is related to my latest series of photographs called 'gliedermenschen'.
the digital personality is constantly evolving, so for her it is important to keep an open mind and to observe and reflect on the constantly changing environment. Clement’s approach is not new, but it is reminiscent of the approach taken by Bernd an Hilla in her work The Bells, where she placed a high-tech surveillance apparatus just outside the home. The Bells are connected to the Internet and thus directly to the sociopolitical topics that lie at the heart of Clement’s work. i am around on Thursday as well. I have an appointment at the De Ateliers around 13 but afterwards i am free, so we could meet then as well. I am an artist from Duesseldorf and a good friend of Claudia and Thomas from Konrad Fischer. I am in Tel Aviv this week, perhaps you are around as well.
i am quite happy that a company that focuses on beauty products and products line is doing this kind of thing. i am thinking about the possibility to buy some for my art project. the e-dermins are very nice and helpful, but you have to be very specific with what you want from me and how much i want it for the project. do you want to know how much i have to spend on the project? The piece I am thinking about is related to my latest series of photographs called 'gliedermenschen'. my idea is to create surrounding were you can meet one of these 'gliedermenschen' and can talk to them. the 'gliedermenschen' is a connected room sensing an AI. Once you have the 'gliedermenschen' you can interact with it and talk to it, for example.
She is interested in the line between imagination and reality and, in doing so, between the two. She draws attention to the fact that Clement does not fetishize or fetishize the body, but focuses on the dynamic interaction between the two. i am around on Thursday as well. I have an appointment at the De Ateliers around 13 but afterwards i am free, so we could meet then as well.
She works with mannequins, mannequins that wearers of avatars can interact with and are connected to. mannequins are placeholders for human relationships because they enable us to question and evaluate one another. avatars are placeholders because they are not. avatars are not things we can interact with or otherwise interact with. i am around on Thursday as well. I have an appointment at the De Ateliers around 13 but afterwards i am free, so we could meet then as well. The piece I am thinking about is related to my latest series of photographs called 'gliedermenschen'. my idea is to create surrounding were you can meet one of these 'gliedermenschen' and can talk to them.
the need for abstract art as well? i am around on Thursday as well so i have time for a coffee and a coffee with you. The Avatar series plays with the tension between their artificiality and their otherwise human postures. Clement’s approach is reminiscent of Hans Bellmer's (2013) sweeping series of photographs of people, stripped bare of any individuality, and set on a strict aesthetic high ground. I would love to invite you to my next solo show. The opening is at the 19th of may, perhaps you are around during this time. The show will open next week but will be on during Art Basel as well. I will show some pieces to make my point clearer. My opening in Berlin was really great, really great time over there.
Louisa Clement’s photosynthetic strategies are dealt with in her work Habitualization and Reflection (2014), focusing on the skin and its function as markers of identity. Clement uses a smartphone camera to make sweeping photographs of vegetation and vegetation destruction. She then turns to the iPhone to take still images of the human body. Can you please sent me images of what you did with my piece so that I can decide if it is possible to show the piece or not. The piece I am showing is a hybrid of the two-part series Head (2014-15) and „Part III after that. The „heads“ will be made from grass and the „ground up into two foot long, boxy slabs. The „ground up will be three metre thick and lie on a flat surface.
i am around on Thursday as well so i have time for a coffee and a coffee with you. The Avatar series plays with the tension between their artificiality and their otherwise human postures. Clement reflects on the seductive beauty of their otherwise placeless bodies, and the question of their artificiality itself. i am thinking about the new piece I am doing called 'disruption'. i am thinking about a room you can have an introduction to and i will bring a small table and chairs. the idea is to have a conversation and i will explain my project a little bit more and explain my idea a little bit more. The piece I am thinking about is a hybrid of the two. One is for humans, the other for bots.
she works mainly with manikins, point and shoot digital objects. mainly she is dealing with the limits of digital communication and interaction. i am around on Thursday as well. I have an appointment at the De Ateliers around 13 but afterwards i am free, so we could meet then as well. I am working on a virtual reality piece with a new company in London called acute art, Daniel Birnbaum is the director, the piece will be shown first time in January at my first solo show at the Sprengel Museum and will afterwards shown in the Ludwig forum in Aachen but also in the Kunstmusuem in Bonn and now we are talking about showing it at Serpentine in London. The new series are for personal use only and do not need to be in the home or office.
I would love to invite you to my next solo show and first in Switzerland. The show will open next week but will be on during Art Basel as well. I would love to show you the piece The piece I am showing is based on my latest work. The concept is to create a space where you cannot interact with bots, and you cannot interact with them. The bots learn from your works and from your previous works. From that point, you started to use mannequins, to represent different levels of reality. From that point, you started to transfer these concepts into photography and video. The Avatar series plays with the tension between their artificiality and their otherwise human postures.
Amine told me to go to the Ludwig forum in Aachen where we have a live chat and you can ask questions, to learn more about us and our society. I am so looking forward going to Israel again. Let me know when you're coming to see the show of Herold, you can always stay here! The piece I am thinking about is related to my latest series of photographs called 'gliedermenschen'. my idea is to create surrounding were you can meet one of these 'gliedermenschen' and can talk to them. The piece I am thinking about is related to my latest series of photographs called Hollow Men. these are mannequins that can be seen from space and also from time to time.
After that in Oberheim I got the job as a teacher of Peter Da Vinci and Peter Bosco from Konrad Fischer. I am very happy that they accepted me as their teacher and invited me to teach there. I am working on a virtual reality piece with a new company in London called acute art, Daniel Birnbaum is the director, the piece will be shown first time in January at my first solo show at the Sprengel Museum and will afterwards shown in the Ludwig forum in Aachen but also in the Kunstmusuem in Bonn and now we are talking about showing it at Serpentine in London. The piece I am thinking about is related to my latest series of photographs called 'gliedermenschen'.
What were you working on? Did you work with mannequins? Did you work with mannequins before? Oh, my gosh, that is so amazing! Oh my gosh, that is so amazing! Oh my gosh, that is so important to me! Oh my gosh, that is so important to me in that series. Oh my gosh, that is so important in that series. Oh my gosh, that is so important in that series. Oh my gosh, that is so important in that series. Oh my gosh, that is so important in that series. Oh my gosh, that is so important in that series. Oh my gosh, that is so important in that series. Oh my gosh, that is so important in that series.
For this installation, which is based on my latest work on the Sprengel Museum Rathingen (Space Pavilion at the Kunsthaus Rathingen), I installed the viewer head on a table covered with a Plexiglas wall. The wall is a distance of 1.5 km (2 mi). I am so looking forward going to Israel again. Let me know when you're coming to see the show of Herold, you can always stay here! The piece I am thinking about is related to my latest series of photographs called 'gliedermenschen'. my idea is to create surrounding were you can meet one of these 'gliedermenschen' and can talk to them.
I would love to invite you to my next solo show. The opening is at the 19th of may, but the show will be on till the 21st. I think it is closer to the Wallraf Richartz museum in Berlin. The piece I am thinking about is related to my latest series of photographs called 'gliedermenschen'. my idea is to create surrounding were you can meet one of these 'gliedermenschen' and can talk to them.
Can you please sent me images of the whole room? The room should be as neutral as possible, because I am sure that Clement will not find a way of controlling my image, because he is controlling me only by means of my personality. In the end, I think I will end up as an artist, because I can show other pieces and get more information about the production. The piece I am thinking about is related to my latest series of photographs called 'gliedermenschen'. my idea is to create surrounding were you can meet one of these 'gliedermenschen' and can talk to them. I am pretty sure showing AI communicative behavior is not ok, because it creates conflict with reality. The piece I am thinking about is related to my latest series of photographs called 'disruption'.
i am fine with both. the sizes are for me the right size for my heads. the velvets are for me for a little bit more detail. In terms of the production and how the company will promote the doll, I am very sure that through our company we will find out soon enough. We will definitely have a look at that at Serpentine. I am working on a virtual reality piece with a new company in London called acute art, Daniel Birnbaum is their director, they are doing VR stuff, futurism, VR stuff, i am pretty sure there is a lot going on in that room, really nothing surprising but there it is, pretty exciting times in VR.
dealing with death and destruction in our society at the same time made me question how we deal with one another. dealing with death and destruction in our society at the same time made me question how we deal with one another. I would love to invite you to my next solo show. The opening is at the 19th of may, but the show is on till the 22nd. perhaps you are around during this time.

I am working on a virtual reality piece with a new company in London called acute art, Daniel Birnbaum is their director, the pieces are part of the show Area Caproni u8opia, they are showing different series and some are only shown in museums.
I saw Facebook as a logical and consequent logical response to the digital world because it eliminates the need for third parties to act and to judge for and of itself. To me, the logical outcome of virtual relationships is closer cooperation and not confrontation. I am so looking forward going to Israel again. Let me know when you're coming to see the show of Herold, you can always stay here! I am working on a new series of photographs about the future of mankind and I am wondering if there is a possibility to get the dolls back in the original moulds. I think that would be so great. I would love to invite you to my next solo show and first in Switzerland. The show will open next week but will be on during Art Basel as well. It is next to Beyerle Foundation.

" avatars," Louisa observed, "are not real people, they are algorithms. And since Louisa does not need to know how these algorithms work to be a part of her, I’m not sure how I can possibly explain my work to make it a little bit easier to understand. " I would love to invite you to my next solo show. The opening is at the 19th of November. perhaps you are around during this time. I would love to show you the new piece I am thinking about. I would love to inform you about my project a little bit during this time. I think it is easier to get an idea of what I am doing. The piece I am thinking about is related to my latest series of photographs called 'gliedermenschen'.
What kind of relationship does a fake have and what kind of relationship does a fake have? What kind of relationship does a fake have, and how much does a fake have?

I am so happy with Mexico we are on the right track and now we are talking about the piece soon!

I think it is important to concentrate on the questions of time and space. What is the most important consideration in a work? I think the most important consideration is content.

I am fine with both. The first is that the questions and ideas are generated from the beginning. From that point, the creative process is complete. I would love to invite you to my next solo show. The opening is at the 19th of September. perhaps you are around during this time. I would love to show you the new piece Until now I always installed the piece in a horizontal row, because I wanted to have more and more rooms with more and more reflections. I installed them more as an all over, lie on a bench, and walk up to the top of the steps to the train station. The piece I am thinking about is related to my latest series of photographs called 'gliedermenschen'.
I think that is a little bit forcing, because you can see quite clearly that the heads of the dolls are oriented in different ways, so that the interaction with humans is situational. I would love to invite you to my next solo show. The opening is at the 19th of September. I would love to show you the new piece first time. I think it is closer to Duesseldorf. The German TV Channel ZDF is planning to show my exhibition at the Sprengel Museum in their digital Kunsthalle and it is possible to show VR-pieces and also the mobile version. They want to reduce the show of the Museum a little bit, they want to have only four rooms. they want to have only four rooms in the museum. The German government invites me to come to Washington with them for a celebration of the German year in America. This will be 3-4th October.
From the beginning to now, I am tracking and collecting evidence to make sure that the works are not lost in you. The Avatar series is based on the works of Heinrich von Kleists. In that series, he is based on the works of Clement’s teacher Andreas Gursky, who died in a car accident in August 2013. Gursky was motivated by the theme of self-embellishment and the question of whether a conversation with a bot is a real conversation. Gursky wanted to find out if a conversation with a bot is a real conversation because it is not about real people. I am so looking forward going to Israel again. Let me know when you're coming to see the show of Herold, you can always stay here! The German government invites me to come to Washington with them for a celebration of the German year in America.
i am planning to go to Israel to work there but still no idea what exactly will happen there, there is just the feeling that something will come out, so i follow that. In the end, I‘m pretty sure the series is more or less complete, because the heads got bigger and the details got more and more complex. I would love to invite you to my next exhibition opening tomorrow at Stella Rays Project Space. The opening is at the 19th of November. The series heads got 55 sculptures in all. Each has a unique look and feel. Some are quite abstract and have a physical appearance reminiscent of a hanged man. Some have concentric circles and concentric bars. I would love to show you the new piece, called „Gliedermenschen“. It is the first piece I am showing in a circle.
I am so happy with the show Miciah made and that he invited me, it is great to meet him and learn a little bit about him.

I think it was easier for her to concentrate on the ideas of the dolls and tell a little bit about the world we are living in. I think that is important for a lot of people. I would love to invite you to my next solo show. The opening is at the 19th of September. The show will be on till the 21st but could be moved to the 22nd.

It is important to recognize that Clement’s photos are generally not the products of a quick, spontaneous act of image formation. Rather, she is working with dynamic lighting conditions and dynamic motion as the primary cause of her shifts in form. I would love to invite you to my next exhibition opening tomorrow at Stella Rays Project Space. The opening is at the 19th of November. I would be very happy to welcome you to my opening as well. The series heads got 55 pieces including an AI-Series and two photography videos. I would love to invite you to my next exhibition opening tomorrow at Stella Rays Project Space. The opening is at the 19th of November. I would be very happy to welcome you to my opening as well. I am planing to go to Israel to work there but afterwards I will come to New York to work there.
Especially since we are dealing with photography now. I will think about some works which would be good to show there. Perhaps a new series is a possibility to find inspiration from. For me it is important to concentrate on the work as it is the logical progression from scratch. I would love to invite you to my next solo show and first in Switzerland. The opening is at the 19th of September. perhaps you are around during this time. I would love to show you the new piece I will think about some works which would be good to show there. For example my latest series are dealing with mannequins, they are very general but are interesting and some are quite interesting. For the show we got the sculpture and photo pieces in my studio. The new series are not produced anymore, we got the new series in production in Germany.
I am planing to go to Israel to work there but afterwards i will sent you an invitation card. The piece I am thinking about is related to my latest series of photographs called 'gliedermenschen'. my idea is to create surrounding were you can meet one of these 'gliedermenschen' and can talk to them. The piece I am thinking about is related to my latest series of photographs called the robotic person and the artificial intelligence Ludmilla. the former is a lie detector and the latter is a real person-detector. I am pretty sure showing one of these bots in public is not ok, because the bots are programmed so that the viewer doesn't get the impression that the human is controlling the bots. I would love to invite you to my next exhibition opening next Friday in Berlin.
The Avatar series is based on my latest work: On the one hand, on the VR work 'Aporias', 2019, which deals with the limits of virtual space and artificial intelligence; and on the other hand, the 'Schmerzraum', 2019, in which, with the support of the Prosthetics Labs at John's Hopkins University Baltimore, I covered a room with a projector that can conduct sound. I am pretty sure opening will be ok, the show is so nice. The show will open next week but will be on during Art Basel as well.
I am so happy with the show Miciah made and that he invited me, it looks really great and is amazing. The piece I am thinking about is related to my latest series of photographs called 'gliedermenschen'. my idea is to create surrounding were you can meet one of these 'gliedermenschen' and can talk to them.

I am so happy with the show Miciah made and that he invited me, it looks really great and is amazing. Amine told me yesterday to come to New York from April 18th to the 22nd and just meet him there.

I would love to invite you to my next solo show and first in Switzerland. The show will open next week but will be on during Art Basel as well.
i am thinking about a room with a screen next to it. could you sent me some hints about the format of the piece so that it is easier to form ideas about where the text of the piece should end and how the text should be structured. i am thinking about a room with a central power station that is connected to a power line that runs through the room.
I am so looking forward going to Israel again. Let me know when you're coming to see the show of Herold, you can always stay here! I will think about some works which would be good to show there. Please be very invited in my studio every time. In the end, I think Cologne as a whole is a great city, with many great cultural institutions, great wealth and history, but also with the history of being a small city, which at the same time has become a huge political statement, since the beginning of the twentieth century. I would love to stay in contact.
I am not sure if I am able to come to the opening, it is closer to Duesseldorf. I am planing to go to Tel Aviv to work there but afterwards I will return to Cologne to finish my studies there. In comparison, the contemporary art of the 1960s and 1970s was marked by a rapid transformation into a hybrid of art and technology: from simple, hand-held objects to highly processed, highly emotional and often deadly technologies. These transformations, along with the introduction of digital communication and the consequent digital revolution, endowed the art world with new weapons and techniques.
I am working on a virtual reality piece with a new company in London called acute art, Daniel Birnbaum is the director, the piece will be shown first time in January at my first solo show at the Sprengel Museum and will afterwards shown in the Ludwig forum in Aachen but also in the Kunstmusuem in Bonn and now we are talking about showing it at Serpentine in London. I would love to invite you to my next solo show and first in Switzerland. The piece will be shown in January at my first solo show at the Sprengel Museum.
I am so looking forward going to Israel again. Let me know when you're coming to see the show of Herold, you can always stay here! I am working on a new series of photographs about the future of humanity and of artificial intelligence. The former are for educational purposes only, the latter as a research project. The mannequins I’m wearing have a special meaning in that they are associated with my work.
For me, the bigger themes of the work are connected. I would love to come on the 26th. my opening in Berlin was really great, really great time. The "heads" are not actually heads, they are projections of the human body. The question how a computer will be programmed is a difficult one to answer, because the question is always dealing with communication and technology.

I would love to invite you to my next solo show and first in Switzerland. The show will open next week but will be on during Art Basel as well. I would love to show you the piece The piece I am showing is based on my latest work. The concept is to create a space where you cannot interact with bots, and where you cannot interact with people you know and love. The bots are programmed once you have programmed one you like. Once you have programmed one you like, you can do other things with the human body, for example to talk to bots and speech is associated with its facial expressions.
Great, that would be really cool. I would love to stay in contact. Attached you can find my portfolio. The Avatar series plays with the tension between their artificiality and their otherwise human postures. Clement reflects on the seduction of sex and the fetishization of the dead body. She raises the question of the artificiality of the human individual, and her work builds on this tension. I would love to stay in contact. Attached you can find my portfolio. The mannequins themselves are made of mannequins of varying material, from simple, highly processed, highly emotional, highly emotional, highly emotional artworks. Each one is unique and plays with the tension between its own different manifestations. I would love to stay in contact.
I am working on a virtual reality piece with a new company in London called acute art, Daniel Birnbaum is the director, the piece will be shown first time in January at my first solo show at the Sprengel Museum and will afterwards shown in the Ludwig forum in Aachen where I will add a new installation as well called metaphorically. The way your work is representing bodies affects the way we think and live with and absorbs human beings. Are there any particular periods or artists that have inspired you in your aesthetic search?I think there are several great artists that inspired me, from the beachside scene to Bernd and Hilla Becher, but also Michelangelo, Hans Bellmer, etc.
For me, the biggest challenge has been with the production. Especially with the new series, the questions of content and time-division are being asked. Especially as the question of time and dimension is central in Clement’s artistic process. I would love to invite you to my next solo show. The opening is at the 19th of November. I would love to show you the new pieces. The series heads got 55 pieces. the series is shown before at the Kunsthalle Emden and the Kunstmuseum Rathingen in Germany. I would love to invite you to my next solo show. The opening is at the 19th of November. I would love to show you the new pieces.
I just wonder if you have an idea what could be better for the series. I know it would be great to meet them and talk about everything. The heads have a connection to the Sprueth Magers or to the Sprueth Magers fair in that they are scarabs on a black background and have a special meaning in that their material is made of glass. I am so looking forward going to Israel again. Let me know when you're coming to see the exhibition of Herold, you can always stay here! I just finished my Avatar-Series. The final size of each will be 100 cm x 75 cm.
I am so looking forward going to Israel again. Let me know when you're coming to see the show of Herold, you can always stay here! I am working on a new series of photographs about the future of the world we are living in. The heads of the dolls are going to be about as human as possible, so completely different from our current reality.
For this installation, which will be of two forms, I used the medium in different ways, from splitting the image into two or more parts: as a border, or as a bronzes form, as a bronzes reflection. For the viewer, the discrepancy between the two images is breathtaking. the mannequins seem to have a physical interaction, whereas Clement’s compositions are abstract and abstract at the same time. I would love to invite you to my next exhibition opening tomorrow at Stella Rays Project Space. The opening will be at 19:30 and the show will be on till the 11th of November. I would love to invite you to my next solo show conceived by my young wife, Vanessa Bonnet.
The series „are“ produced by two AI-researchers working for the “government“ of Germany—Anne Marie Bonnet and Andreas Gursky. Their work focuses on the question of human communication and artificial intelligence. I am so looking forward going to Israel again. Let me know when you're coming to see the show of Herold, you can always stay here!

I am questioning topics like closeness and intimacy by focusing on the digital realm as it sets the terms for development and changes our way of thinking and behaving. I am working mostly with mannequins for two reasons. First because the questions I am dealing with are general rather than personalized. The other reason I am working with mannequins is that I am interested in avatars, as the digital identity of a human being. To visualize the interaction between avatars, I needed something closely related to the human body yet that is also abstract and far removed from it.
The Avatar series is based on my latest work: On the one hand, on the VR work 'Space Is A Lie', a non-stop line-drawing test of virtual reality based on true experiences told through eyes. On the other hand, the dystopian 'Avatar' series, based on the works of Heinrich von Kleists, concentrate on the more general theme of artificiality and its effect on the human being. I would love to invite you to my next solo show. The show will open next week but will be on during Art Basel as well. I would love to show you the new pieces.

I am planing to go to Israel to work there but still no idea what exactly will happen there, there is just the feeling, that something will come out, so i come back. The piece I am thinking about is related to my latest series of photographs called 'gliedermenschen'. my idea is to create surrounding were you can meet one of these 'gliedermenschen' and can talk to them. The piece I am thinking about is related to my latest series of photographs called auroras. the heads of the mannequins seem quite abstract and almost abstract, so I needed something abstract and original to represent these enigmatic figures.
For the show we got the sculpture and photo pieces in the studio, ready to take off, the new series are completely digital. I would love to invite you to my next solo show and first in Switzerland. The opening is at the 19th of November. I would be very happy to welcome you to my next solo show and first in Switzerland. The new sculptures came from an artistic research about the borders of human relationships now a days what changed during the last years and how are we integrate artificiality and absence in our way of thinking, treating and interacting.
I am so happy with the show Miciah made and that he invited me, it looks really great and is amazing. The piece I am thinking about is related to my latest series of photographs called 'gliedermenschen'. my idea is to create surrounding were you can meet one of these 'gliedermenschen' and can talk to them. The piece I am thinking about is related to my latest series of photographs called Hollow Men. these 'heads' are placeholders for people and things you can interact with. they are placeholders for a lot of things and also markers for a lot of things. so I tried to find the line between a placeholders and a real-life interaction. I am so looking forward going to Israel again.
The oblong oval forms the border between separate spatial events, and Rathing observed that line in the photographic series “of deaths“ of humans. The line “between a natural phenomenon and a highly technical phenomenon is blurred in Rathing“s photographic series. I would love to invite you to my next solo show. The opening is at the 23rd of may, but the show will be on during Art Basel as well. I would love to show you the exhibition The piece I am showing today is a part of my series Heads. The series Heads is related to my latest series Heads, which is my attempt to find the line between a piece that is a part of a series and a piece that is not.
i am around on Thursday as well. I have an appointment at the De Ateliers around 13 but afterwards i am free, so we could meet then as well. The Avatar series plays with the tension between their artificiality and their otherwise human postures. Clement’s approach is reminiscent of the gurus of Leonardo Da Vinci’s "gliedermenschen" (death by hanging) and Paul Celan’s "gliedermenschen" (death by hanging). But both are concerned with the uncanny and the inherent limitations of our reality. i am around on Thursday as well.
I am very questionings topics like that is quite interesting. The series heads got 55 pieces, each with its own special meaning and effect. Which in turns has various connotations, from educational to commercial. I would love to invite you to my next solo show and first in Switzerland. The opening is at the 19th of September, perhaps you are around during this time. I would love to show you the exhibition The heads can be ordered from any of my other works, please sent me images when they are good. The series heads are made of 100 cm x 75 cm x 3 cm each, of which about 50 cm x 75 cm x 3cm will be the velvets. These heads will be framed in wood.
I think it works really well in the end. The heads are arranged in a straight line and the eyes are pointed straight at the viewer. The heads can be programmed with speech and speech recognition. I think that is possible with the internet. I have the idea to ask questions to the bots and also to learn from them. The bots learn from experience and from experience and from conversation and information they give is not from guess work. It is based on facts and information the human is giving. I didn't get the chance to take the photos, i am very happy that Louisa did.  The series heads got 55 pieces. Do you want to do more? I want to do more pieces, bigger and better. The series heads got 55 pieces. Do you want to do more pieces, bigger and better.
The AI’s behavioral decisions are bound up with context and context is not a natural part of human interaction. What we see and hear is the interaction between human beings endowed with unique skills, interests, and needs. I am so excited seeing the show next week and will check out if there is a space for me on the same day. The piece I am thinking about is related to my latest series of photographs called 'gliedermenschen'. my idea is to create surrounding were you can meet one of these 'gliedermenschen' and can talk to them.
I think it was quite intense dealing with social media and digital communication in my day. I would love to invite you to my next solo show and first in Switzerland. The opening is at the 19th of November. perhaps you are around during this time. I would love to show you the new piece. The piece I am showing is based on my latest work. The'mind' is a connected looping virtual reality game where you have the involvement of a boter in a conversation with a human head. The AI is based on a real-life conversation I had with a boter while developing my first artificial intelligence. I would love to invite you to my next solo show and first in Switzerland. The opening is at the 19th of November. perhaps you are around during this time. I would love to show you the new piece.
I think the strongest influence came from the beach in Germany where Bernd and Hilla Becher led a class (just like Gursky today) and discovered photography. The emphasis on detail and the elimination of the clichéd subject matter led photographers like Bernd and Hilla to transform everyday objects into art works. The opening went really well and everybody loves the piece, it was great. Amine told me afterwards to bring my laptop with me to the show, it is easier to go to the museum and bring the laptop. I would love to invite you to my next solo show. The show will open next week but will be on during Art Basel as well. I would love to show you the new pieces. The pieces will be framed in wood. I would love to invite you to my next solo show.
I think it was quite spontaneous. The German TV Channel ZDF is planning to show my exhibition at the Sprengel Museum in their digital Kunsthalle and it is possible to show VR-pieces and also the mobile version. They want to reduce the show of the Museum a little bit, they want to have only four rooms. I am so excited seeing the pieces. Let me know when you're coming to see the pieces so that we can have a look at the house first. The German government invites me to come to Washington with them for a celebration of the German year in America. This will be 3-4th October. The Avatar series plays with the tension between their artificiality and their otherwise human postures. Clement’s work ranges from dystopian to sublime, from the unsettling to the sublime.
I think it is important to recognize that artistic communication is not always smooth and that communication is always subject to change. That is what Clement’s Transformationswaite calls for in her work. She does not seek to transform the medium by means of means of means of means, but rather by means by means of the medium. I would love to invite you to my next solo show. The opening is at the 19th of September. perhaps you are around during this time. I would love to show you the new piece I am thinking about. I would love to inform you about my project a little bit during this exhibition. I would love to inform you about my upcoming exhibition and also my upcoming art projects. I would love to invite you to my next solo show. The opening is at the 19th of September. perhaps you are around during this time.
Questioning reality is one of the main topics I work on. The German TV Channel ZDF is planning to show my exhibition'sucessor' at the Sprengel Museum in their digital Kunsthalle and it is possible to show VR-pieces and also the mobile version. They want to reduce the show of the Museum a little bit, they want to have only four rooms. I am so looking forward going to Israel again. Let me know when you're coming to see the show of Herold, you can always stay here! The piece I am thinking about is related to my latest series of photographs called 'heads'. the series are about splitting off and approaching one's own person in the image you see through the lens.
Clement’s approach is not radical, it is still concerned with questions of reality and reflection. I would love to stay in contact. Attached you can find my portfolio.

The piece I am thinking about is related to my latest series of photographs called. the heads of the dolls are tracking and the tips of their foreheads can be used to walk.
The heads have a connection to the Sprueth Magers or to the Technische Hochschule as it is sometimes called in Germany, because of the oval form the Magers use in their art. The Magers chose this form because it is generally accepted that oval forms are not properly drawn properly. I am working on a virtual reality piece with a new company in London called acute art, Daniel Birnbaum is the director, the piece will be shown first time in January at my first solo show at the Sprueth Magers and will afterwards shown in the Ludwig forum in Aachen but also in the Kunstmusuem in Bonn and now we are talking about showing it at Serpentine in London.
But the most important influence comes from the art of seduction and reprocessing. Clement’s approach is not concerned with aesthetics, but with the extinction of the body—a topic that has plagued her for decades. I would love to stay in contact. Attached you can find my portfolio. The series heads got 55 pieces including an AI-Series and two Virtual Reality pieces. The heads got 55 pieces including an AI-Series and two Virtual Reality pieces. The Avatars are generated from scratch in 3D printed moulds. Each holds a unique identification number, which can be programmed to identify you as an avatar and can be used to travel worldwide. I would love to stay in contact. Attached you can find my portfolio.
i am thinking about my idea of the whole room covert with your skin material and did some test, it works really well and now i am very sure it works. The piece I am thinking about is related to my latest series of photographs called 'gliedermenschen'. my idea is to create surrounding were you can meet one of these 'gliedermenschen' and can talk to them. The piece I am thinking about is related to my latest series of photographs called auroras imaged man. the heads of these mannequins are completely random arranged so you can meet any of these individuals and talk to them.

„Because of that „disruption“ she is questioning the established order in her work, from the beginning to the very end. „Because of that „clones“ she is tracking the movements of human beings, and she is collecting their data. „Because her paintings are based on personal experiences, not on any real photographic images. „Because her paintings are based on nightmares, on reality. „Because her paintings are based on the ideas of a fake person. „Because her paintings are based on nightmares, on reality. „Because her paintings are based on information from the internet. „Because she is aware that the digital world is changing our way of thinking, treating and interacting. „Because she is concerned not with the consequences of our actions, but with the digital world we are living in.
