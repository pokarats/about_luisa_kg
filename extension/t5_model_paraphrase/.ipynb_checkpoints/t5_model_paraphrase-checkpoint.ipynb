      "Great, that would be really cool. The Avatar series is based on my latest work: On the one hand, on the VR work of Hans Bellmer and Bruce Nauman, two self-portrait series that use the iPhone to imagerically gather information about human interaction in the real world. On the other hand, the dystopian genre-western genre-western, where the iPhone is connected to the Internet, is routinely used to gather information on the human body and its interaction. I would love to stay in contact. Attached you can find my portfolio. The series heads got 55 images per panel, each of them dealing with a different aspect of the human body. From there, the series heads can be downloaded for individual presentation or as part of a larger exhibition.\n",
      "For me, the most intense exploration of the human body leads me to sculptures of sex doll shells I made. I was interested in the line between imagination and reality, between the two. line between two or more individuals is blurred in the mass production of these 'empty' bodies. I needed something closely related to the human body yet that is also abstract and far removed from it. I would love to invite you to my next solo show. The opening is at the 19th of may, but the show will be on till the 21st. I would love to show you the new pieces. The series heads got 55 pieces. the series is shown before at the Kunsthalle Emden and the Kunstmuseum Rathingen in Germany. The heads got 55 pieces.\n",
      "For me, the most intense exploration comes when I meet new people and the chance encounters of real people. The German TV Channel ZDF is planning to show my exhibition 'Amerikaner Essen' next week at the Sprengel Museum in their digital Kunsthalle and it is possible to show VR-pieces and also the mobile version. They want to reduce the show of the Museum a little bit, they want to have only four rooms. I would love to invite you to my next solo show and first in Switzerland. The show will open next week but will be on during Art Basel as well. I would love to show you the new pieces. The German government invites me to come to Washington with them for a celebration of the German year in America. This will be 3-4th October.\n",
      "What are you working on now?I am working on a virtual reality piece with a new company in London called acute art, Daniel Birnbaum is the director, the piece will be shown first time in January at my first solo show at the Sprengel Museum and will afterwards shown in the Ludwig forum in Aachen where I will add a new installation as well called Rexport. The German TV Channel ZDF is planning to show my exhibition at the Sprengel Museum in their digital Kunsthalle and it is possible to show VR-pieces and also the mobile version. They want to reduce the show of the Museum a little bit, they want to have only four rooms.\n",
      "I am in Berlin during Art Basel, from the beginning to the end of the 1990s. Perhaps you can make it to see the exhibition. The mannequins are made of 100% water-tight, 100% breathable polyethylene. I am working on a virtual reality piece with a new company in London called acute art, Daniel Birnbaum is the director, the piece will be shown first time in January at my first solo show at the Sprengel Museum and will afterwards shown in the Ludwig forum in Aachen but also in the Kunstmusuem in Bonn and now we are talking about showing it at Serpentine in London. The mannequins are not tracking. they are tracking.\n",
      "I am sometimes dealing with the human body and AI a lot. For this installation you need not only the floorplan, as well with the chairs, as well the shelves, which are linoleum-like as well. I installed them completely free of cost in the studio and afterwards they are framed in wood. For the viewer the experience of the piece is unique, because the moving pieces are completely abstracted and rendered in the virtual world. The viewer is led to believe that for every moving individual ’individual piece of the ’work’, there is at least one ’digital’ counterpart. I would love to invite you to my next solo show. The show will open next week but will be on during Art Basel as well. I would love to show you the new pieces. The series heads got 55 pieces, each with 50 pieces.\n",
      "I am working mostly with mannequins, doll heads, stadiums, and more. I am in Tel Aviv from the 21.-28.7. The Avatar series plays with the tension between their artificiality and their otherwise human postures. Clement’s approach is reminiscent of Georg Herold’s “realism” (physicality aside), in which individuals are portrayed as living beings in a posthuman, incorporeally arranged world. Clement reflects on the artist’s approach by focusing on the joints and joints themselves. I am so looking forward going to Israel again. Let me know when you're coming to see the show of Herold, you can always stay here! The piece I am thinking about is related to my latest series of photographs called 'gliedermenschen'.\n",

      "For the show we got the sculpture and photo pieces in my studio, the new series called 'gliedermenschen'. the series heads got 55 pieces. the series is shown before on the 21st and 22nd at Konrad Fischer Gallery in Duesseldorf. I am so looking forward going to Israel again.\n",
      "i am around on Thursday as well so i have a small exhibition at the Sprengel museum Hannover (29.1 opening) and a video production on Saturday as well. The title of the exhibition is a bit vague, but Clement’s sculpture sets out in part the question of a contemporary relationship between two worlds: one virtual and one real. What is the relationship between virtual and real? What is the relationship between man and machine? What are the social consequences of acting differently? What are the social consequences of acting differently? What are the political consequences of acting differently? What are the costs of living differently? These are questions that Clement refers to in her work.\n"
