i came up with this idea last year during my research about futurism and the question how people will interact and live together. as i work a lot about human interaction and the question what about humanity nowadays and how technology is connected to our life’s. 
the piece is now running without me what i think is quite interesting, the bots learn from the conversations they are having and every conversation they have is unique what is also interesting for the viewer, it is an unique experience nobody can have the same conversation, what i also think is interesting.

in recent years, though, interventions in the human body by technology and medicine have taken on a new quality, and as a result the question of the boundaries of the human has acquired an alarming prominence. in its extreme forms, or in visionary concepts, the classical human–machine opposition has been morphed into a hybrid form that focuses attention on the question of where humanity’s borders lie.

i will have my first exhibition at konrad fischer gallery duesseldorf in january next year, and it would be great if we would have a text about the pieces i am showing. i know it is a little bit spontaneous, we would need the text before christmas. 
actually there no specific point, i was always dealing with art on different levels, so there was never something like a decision to make art, it was the logical step to study art and make art.

i was very intensively busy with my portrait project, which means, i prepared the ai with answering questions about myself, personal life, art, and working life. that was quite intense, while reflecting and thinking about making that all open, was in the process quite challenging to be ok with. 
i didn’t choose to become a photographer, i am an artist. but of course for me photography developed into the main medium with which i transform content into something visualized. at kunstakademie düsseldorf, he teaches what is called an "open class" (freie kunst), which is not explicitly a photography class. the focus in gursky’s teaching was always about having a strong connection between content and visual quality.

so how is the question of the altered image of the human that we have outlined articulated in the work of clement? is her explicit artistic purpose to raise questions about the interpersonal and about contemporary political topics in her work?

kunstakademie düsseldorf is where bernd and hilla becher led a class (just like gursky today) and established what became the so-called becher or düsseldorf photo school. in their class were artists like laurenz berges, andreas gursky, candida höfer, axel hütte, thomas ruff, jörg sasse, thomas struth, so it is obviously one of the best places to study if your work has anything to do with photography. the exchange with them is very frequent, not only in the academy but also in daily life as well.

i see my work more and more questioning the world and developing into a bigger statement like a complete work subdivided into series and pieces as a part of the whole thing. 
gursky teached me to find my own way as an artist, to deal with the point of time and questioning the relevant of the topics i was dealing with, what is it worth to be an art piece? he forced me to be straight and claim for a high level of content and visually. 
i didn't get the images can you sent them to me again? oh and here some images of my recent show in berlin opened last week. 
the piece is now running without me what i think is quite interesting, the bots learn from the conversations they are having and every conversation they have is unique what is also interesting for the viewer, it is an unique experience nobody can have the same conversation, what i also think is interesting.

real bodies (i.e., real people) are eliminated via (digital) remote control. for the operator, the effects of individual action are thus virtualized and trivialized in the starkest contrast to the real effects on real people being killed or injured. 
conversations she has when she is in the world can form and change her, so that she, like people, changes with and absorbs the influences of the world. the possibility that it completely changes i find very exciting because i also do not know who or what happens to me in life and how that changes me, it is as if the dolls lead other lives for me. for me, it's a lot about splitting off and approaching one's own person in the image that one has created for and of oneself.

i was at the opening, the show is so wonderful, really intense. 
for the artists who discovered photography at the beginning of the 1960s had untapped opportunities in the medium or, as jan dibbets said in retrospect. "in those days photography was regarded as a completely useless medium, and if it was used, then only for the documentation of things. " while dibbets was interested in the perspective characteristics of the photograph, a decade later, hans-peter feldmann was working on the discrepancy of what we know from an image and what we see in it, e.g. when he photographed car radios, while good music was playing. 
i would advise to every young person, to work hard, concentrate on the work and questioning yourself what is worth to be an art work in terms of content and intention. see as much art as possible and reflect the world you are living in. 
walking distance is always time distance as well and everyone finds it fascinating how trails and then routes are established, how grass and vegetation overall are displaced over time. many people choose an efficient and rational, normally the shortest route between two points, a line which remains visible after a while – like ant trail in the forest.

at the moment i'm trying to find further boundaries, both in terms of media and content, and to ask the questions about the real and the artificial in our world even more animalistically. that's exactly how i am reminding and making aware of topics that occupy me and that i am working on. 
i will basically focused on the way of production of bernd an hilla becher,then how they teach, how the 'duesseldorf school' came up, what kind of production do we see and how do they work and how they find their inspiration. after that i will talk about how my educational way was, what gursky taught in his class and what i learn from him and how we see photography nowadays, therefore i would name jan dibbets. i know he is from amsterdam but he taught in duesseldorf as well and did this amazing show of photography in paris, pandoras box, i would bring the catalogue, and talk about borders of photography, just short but i think this is super important. i will show some pieces to make a little bit clearer what i am doing, the way of thinking behind and the concept. 
i am an artist from germany and coming to tel aviv tomorrow for some days. 
actually there no specific point, i was always dealing with art on different levels, so there was never something like a decision to make art, it was the logical step to study art and make art. 
since there is a performative act in the video series not lost in you and one person acts with the avatar, but i consider the basic feeling and question of the work to be something general that everyone knows, i also wanted to abstract and generalize the human body from the person acting in the video, to achieve this i chose the ornamental nylon fabrics.

i am thinking about coming to new york in march during the armory show, i am involved in a exhibition at the huis marseille in amsterdam about the becher school and duesseldorfs photography, if they don't need me installing my pieces ( i am quiet sure they don't) i can come to new york. 
no, i‘m not. for me, the different levels of communication are the main topic of the series. the question has always been, is digital communication something different than a real, face-to-face communication between human beings? 
to me technology i a tool to transfer a content into an art piece, so if i have an idea in mind a content for an art piece i am searching for the strongest medium to form that content. 
here is my new first sketch, i am still thinking about doors in the background where the mannequins can come and leave but perhaps they can just come from the side, we will see. 
here in germany my frist institutional solo exhibition at the sprengel museum is going really well and will now shown in the first digital kunsthalle of the german tv channel zdf and is going afterwards to the ludwig forum in aachen where i will add a new installation as well. so very exciting times right now. 
the avatar is a digital identity, as i am dealing a lot with communication and digital communication in my work, mostly the question how the way of communication affected us and what is the meaning of the way we use to communicate. to make situation of communication visual i used mannequins, because the avatar is actually nothing really visual for me. i decided to use mannequins because i want to have the questions i am dealing with in my work generalized and not connected to one special person or me. 
i would be very happy to welcome you in april in my studio. please let me know when it is a good time for you the first part of the month i am completely free, so any time is good for me. 
i don't have my favourite courier. for me it is important that the pieces are insured and we need to do something like a contract if that is ok for you, about the shipping back and forth and how long the pieces will stay with you. i need just a contract between us, so if we can make that till thursday that would be great otherwise i cannot sent the work. 
the medium is always related to the content of the work, so i’m always trying to find the best medium for the questions i am dealing with. there is not really one medium i prefer, it is a question on process and reflection which leads me to the work as it is in the end.

my name is louisa clement, i am an artist from germany 
first of all i have to say that i was very happy about the invitation from you to be part of the show. i like your project very much! 
most of my pieces are dealing with the question of human communication and interaction in our recent world and the digital world. 
in terms of the production and how the company will promote the doll, i am working on a contract with a lawyer to make sure that the company will not use my images for other things and promotion, as well every picture of the doll will be only in commitment with me (don’t want to see that piece on you porn you know). 
my summer was great, israel was amazing, such an inspiring place, i am thinking about going there next month again, we will see. 
until now i always installed the piece in a horizontal row, just once in a presentation in france i installed them more as an all over, please be free to install them how it is the best for the whole exhibition. the works will be framed in wood.

the opening went really well and everybody loves the piece, it was great. 
there are only a few artists who in their artworks or installations make use of the objects and materials of war (and hence death) itself. one unusual exception is louisa clement’s installation transformationsschnitt (transformation section, 2015). 
as i’m becoming more and more aware of how difficult and intense this piece is, i want to ask you if you want to work with that piece. i think it is hard to handle but i am sure we can do that and it will be really a new step, but could be a bit forcing.

the german tv channel zdf build a digital museum and invited me to show my exhibition of the sprengel museum in this museum as well, it is a completely different way to think about the pieces we will see what comes out of it. 
the illusion that the viewer and especially the art buyer, who has no rules or limits in dealing with the doll (as with any art purchase), is part of the work for me. 
first of all i have to say that i was very happy about the invitation from you to be part of the show. i like your project very much!

a lot good things right now, it is really a good time i have to say ( head is exploding of ideas, that makes super happy). 
can you please sent me images of what you did with my piece so that i can decide if it is possible to show the piece or not.

the work is produced by a company that specializes in sex robots.

also you have to try not to think too much in this weird kind of being a doll and try to stay human, sound strange but this is floating a lot. 
the human body is the smallest room you as an individual has to deal with. this room is set in the space around you. i am trying to trying to find the line between being inside of this room and outside, what is impact you have on the outside and of other individuals. i choose the present and the absent of the body because i think this is one of the most changing and stabile topics at the same time in our society at the same time.
