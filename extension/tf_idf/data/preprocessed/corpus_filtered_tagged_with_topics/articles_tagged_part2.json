And in the delicate pastel shades that reveal not only the artist’s sensitivity to color but also how Clement’s development started in painting before moving on to photography.“ This painterly look, not at all uncommon in modern photographic history, is emphasized by the use of the smartphone camera and the resulting shallow depth of field of the picture.",
