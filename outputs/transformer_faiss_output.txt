I still working on my impressions of LA it was really an amazing time over there.
There is a long history in photography of representing mannequins, puppets, or dolls—are you referencing other artists' works? Think of the Surrealists, Vanessa Beecroft, Laurie Simmons, Hans Bellmer, etc.Of course, I am aware of these artists, the use of mannequins, and their relevance in art history. Bellmer and Cindy Sherman have been especially important for my series. But the most important influence is Oskar Schlemmer and his theories about the ideal human in space.
of course you can use my work, i think it looks really great!!! thank you so much for choosing my image that is a big honour for me in that huge context. Can you sent me some invitations when they are printed?
During some researches I found a paper about the e-dermins perceives touch and pain. I am more than impressed about this development and very interested in this material. I am working a lot about the human body and the future of the human body. 
I am recently thinking a lot about the theories about posthumanism and transhumanism today. I am actually focusing on the philosophical discussion and the question what the changes of technique and upgrades of the human body does in terms of society and ethic skills. To me this is really interesting at the moment we have so much changes and developments people are in between attraction, fear and need. 
Impressive who the body react and of course more pressure in a smaller area of the body leads to pain. To me this way of thinking about the body and pain is very important for my work.

In recent years, though, interventions in the human body by technology and medicine have taken on a new quality, and as a result the question of the boundaries of the human has acquired an alarming prominence. In its extreme forms, or in visionary concepts, the classical human–machine opposition has been morphed into a hybrid form that focuses attention on the question of where humanity’s borders lie.

What got you into making art?Actually there no specific point, I was always dealing with art on different levels, so there was never something like a decision to make art, it was the logical step to study art and make art.
The question how aporias is programmed I cannot not answer, I am very sorry, acute art is doing all the programming stuff and I am only involved in artistic decisions and tell them what I want :) very computable.
Why photography?Because I like that the picture is generated from the world we are existing in. From this basis of that “real” photograph I am working through my questions, and transform the image into that question. As I am working with questions and issues related to our current everyday life, I always need to have one foot in this daily world.
In 2015 you graduated at Kunstakademie Düsserldorf as a master student of Andreas Gursky. What is the most important thing you learnt from him?Gursky teached me to find my own way as an artist, to deal with the point of time and questioning the relevant of the topics I was dealing with, what is it worth to be an art piece? He forced me to be straight and claim for a high level of content and visually.
Can you first tell me how you chose to become a photographer and what led you to working with Professor Andreas Gursky?I didn’t choose to become a photographer, I am an artist. But of course for me photography developed into the main medium with which I transform content into something visualized. At Kunstakademie Düsseldorf, he teaches what is called an "open class" (Freie Kunst), which is not explicitly a photography class. The focus in Gursky’s teaching was always about having a strong connection between content and visual quality.
of course you can use my work, i think it looks really great!!! thank you so much for choosing my image that is a big honour for me in that huge context. Can you sent me some invitations when they are printed?
Sarin, Richard Long, Robert Smithson, Sam Durant and Louisa Clement therefore exist in a genealogy of a spatial, political time stamping level, which contents of materiality always interact with and express a political consequence or motivation of action. I find it extraordinary that Louisa Clement, whose work methods of photographical observation of her surroundings and quotidian always had a constant, with this radical sculptural statement phrases a new view, a haptic dimension in the virtual space of possibility that is everyday warfare. Many thanks for this! Even if we are momentarily speechless in the face of the contemporary reality of a flood of refugees and refugee politics in Europe.
So how is the question of the altered image of the human that we have outlined articulated in the work of Clement? Is her explicit artistic purpose to raise questions about the interpersonal and about contemporary political topics in her work?

Where does your interest in the objectification of the human body come from?The human body is the smallest room you as an individual has to deal with. This room is set in the space around you. I am trying to trying to find the line between being inside of this room and outside, what is impact you have on the outside and of other individuals. I choose the present and the absent of the body because i think this is one of the most changing and stabile topics at the same time in our society at the same time.
My work is dealing with communication and emotion in our age.

This sort of contemporaneity is already discernible in her on one’s way series produced in 2012–13. She shows cut-out-like details of railway train interiors. With these abstracted views—not initially identifiable, but then becoming perceptible for what they are—we can talk of a transformation of the visual experience of everyday things. Sven Beckstette rightly draws attention to the way that Clement here has “chosen perspectives and then edited the images in such a way that the details drawn from known reality dissolve into geometric, abstract compositions. And in the delicate pastel shades that reveal not only the artist’s sensitivity to color but also how Clement’s development started in painting before moving on to photography.“ This painterly look, not at all uncommon in modern photographic history, is emphasized by the use of the smartphone camera and the resulting shallow depth of field of the picture.
As I’m becoming more and more aware of how difficult and intense this piece is, I want to ask you if you want to work with that piece. I think it is hard to handle but I am sure we can do that and it will be really a new step, but could be a bit forcing.
Has the legacy of the Düsseldorf School been helpful to your current and prior successes?Kunstakademie Düsseldorf is where Bernd and Hilla Becher led a class (just like Gursky today) and established what became the so-called Becher or Düsseldorf Photo School. In their class were artists like Laurenz Berges, Andreas Gursky, Candida Höfer, Axel Hütte, Thomas Ruff, Jörg Sasse, Thomas Struth, so it is obviously one of the best places to study if your work has anything to do with photography. The exchange with them is very frequent, not only in the academy but also in daily life as well.

The 'mind' should be an AI based on personal data and information about me as an artist and as a person and it should develop further by information from the internet and again the conversation the Roboter has. So far a relatively ambitious project where the technology must be very precise.

As promised I sent you pictures of the whole series of the heads and the Avatars. Below the link to my website were you can see more works.  And if that is ok for you I would love to inform you about my exhibitions and keep you informed about my work.
the base station are not tracking properly sometimes it works and sometimes not. glasses as well, but you can hear what they are talking, the mannequins need to sit on the table.  the table should be out of linoleum not glass

A new sculptural work is part of the show Area Caproni u8opia. Do you want to tell us more about this sculpture in particular?The new sculptures came from an artistic research about the borders of human relationships now a days what changed during the last years and how are we integrate artificiality and absence in our way of thinking, treating and interacting. That leads me to sex dolls and the question of an image your counterpart has to fit in. I was interested in the line between imagination and reality. What kind of image you fill in a person, how big is the part of imagination? I saw the border in the production moulds of sex dolls, these edge between the part where the material for the body will be filled in and the frame which holds the two mould together. These Edge is for me that line.
I came up with this idea last year during my research about futurism and the question how people will interact and live together. As I work a lot about human interaction and the question what about humanity nowadays and how technology is connected to our life’s.
Where will our society be going when we are completely digital? In a series like heads, this is the question that Louisa Clement asks of us as viewers.
You work mainly with manikins, distorting and abstracting the human body. Can you explain how your work deals with closeness and intimacy?I am questioning topics like closeness and intimacy by focusing on the digital realm as it sets the terms for development and changes our way of thinking and behaving. I am working mostly with mannequins for two reasons. First because the questions I am dealing with are general rather than personalized. The other reason I am working with mannequins is that I am interested in avatars, as the digital identity of a human being. To visualize the interaction between avatars, I needed something closely related to the human body yet that is also abstract and far removed from it.
Conversations she has when she is in the world can form and change her, so that she, like people, changes with and absorbs the influences of the world. The possibility that it completely changes I find very exciting because I also do not know who or what happens to me in life and how that changes me, it is as if the dolls lead other lives for me. For me, it's a lot about splitting off and approaching one's own person in the image that one has created for and of oneself.

For the viewer the question is left open, although the motion in the work is particularly unsettling. Louisa Clement has surely not yet pursued her artistic questions about the state of mankind and a contemporary comprehension of humanity to the very end. It is already becoming apparent that her work, both within and outside of the context of classical photographic images, is pressing on into a new sort of artistic image.
Impressive who the body react and of course more pressure in a smaller area of the body leads to pain. To me this way of thinking about the body and pain is very important for my work.
But the dummies are not conveying a sales-oriented message. Rather, Clement is reversing the meaning of the images. the substitute human is acting as a reflection not of reality but of its simulation.
In her work, Clement does not fall for the simple pictorial rhetoric of explicitly representing real facts. she does not work with imagery downloaded from war zones and depictions of the dead and injured.
photographically i am working on a series about stopping the age, there are several new studies on that which are quite interesting and i like this very old topic and question nobody has answered until now and of course the question if it would be good to find a solution.

What are you working on now?At the moment I'm trying to find further boundaries, both in terms of media and content, and to ask the questions about the real and the artificial in our world even more animalistically. That's exactly how I am reminding and making aware of topics that occupy me and that I am working on.

User-friendly controls have made digital operation the norm, transforming our entire global communications culture. These crucial consequences for a contemporary concept of reality, and its effects on the world we live in, caused Clement to question the fundamentals of her previous artistic work. Clement took as her starting point the status quo of digital image production, and in her creations she not only raises the question of the extinction of analogue photography but also pursues the debate about the function of the image in the context of digitization.
All the same, complete uniformity is fended off with various different colors, shapes, and outer surfaces of the objects, and with the startling variety of image sizes, so that one really can talk of anthropomorphic residues. These allusions to human appearances generate an emotional unease in the observer that strongly recalls the surreal tradition of the doll photographs of Hans Bellmer (1902–1975).
Conversations she has when she is in the world can form and change her, so that she, like people, changes with and absorbs the influences of the world. The possibility that it completely changes I find very exciting because I also do not know who or what happens to me in life and how that changes me, it is as if the dolls lead other lives for me.

I love the title and the list of artists as well. It will be a really great show! I will check out if i can change the date for the other exhibition.
Even if, in the context of discussion of photography, it is tempting to pass over the question of pictorial content in favor of clarifying technical development, there is nonetheless one technical detail that should be covered first—because it is the hallmark of the artist’s thoroughgoing conceptual approach. In contrast to many well-known photographers (Hiroshi Sugimoto, for example) who use a nineteenth-century plate camera, Clement employs not a large-format camera for high-resolution images but the camera on her smartphone, thus utilizing an everyday object to produce art.

I will basically focused on the way of production of Bernd an Hilla Becher,then how they teach, how the 'duesseldorf school' came up, what kind of production do we see and how do they work and how they find their inspiration. After that i will talk about how my educational way was, what Gursky taught in his class and what i learn from him and how we see photography nowadays, therefore i would name Jan Dibbets. i know he is from Amsterdam but he taught in Duesseldorf as well and did this amazing show of photography in Paris, pandoras box, i would bring the catalogue, and talk about borders of photography, just short but i think this is super important. I will show some pieces to make a little bit clearer what i am doing, the way of thinking behind and the concept.
I will talk about how to find ideas and inspiration. i will talk about a very recent project what will come up in May, i think that is the best way, to break the borders, something not ready, so they can ask and see what it is really about. therefore as well i would bring research material or include that in my digital portfolio as you like. for me it is important that the students always can ask question or tell what they see or what they don't like for example
As your work often deals with communication and technology, do you have any particular observation about social media in the past few months of quarantine?I believe that digital communication was a great relief at that time as a bridging factor and for me time has proven once again that the purely digital is not a possibility for human interaction. The human being needs the real counterpart and the direct contact.
Can you first tell me how you chose to become a photographer and what led you to working with Professor Andreas Gursky?I didn’t choose to become a photographer, I am an artist. But of course for me photography developed into the main medium with which I transform content into something visualized. At Kunstakademie Düsseldorf, he teaches what is called an "open class" (Freie Kunst), which is not explicitly a photography class. The focus in Gursky’s teaching was always about having a strong connection between content and visual quality.
Can you tell me a little about your use of avatars and mannequins?The avatar is a digital identity, as I am dealing a lot with communication and digital communication in my work, mostly the question how the way of communication affected us and what is the meaning of the way we use to communicate. To make situation of communication visual I used mannequins, because the avatar is actually nothing really visual for me. I decided to use mannequins because I want to have the questions I am dealing with in my work generalized and not connected to one special person or me.
Conscious and mindful perception is denied to human beings in the digital world and its social forums. Hence, in the not lost in you series (2017, pp. 34–39) the former puppets are touched and palpated performatively with a real hand on a human body. This exemplifies the missing physical contact. In one of her earliest Portrait series, Clement had already made detail photographs of body parts covered with sometimes eye-catching clothing like leopard prints. But these images, resembling cutouts or clippings and aesthetically reminiscent of articles posted online, do not reveal the person depicted in their entirety. The works have titles such as liked (2013, fig. 2) and illustrate the play on absence despite presence. They reduce to absurdity the self-esteem derived from public recognition and the fetishizing of one’s own appearance by means of the new technologies, and conversely they comment on the changed, fake body consciousness and self-embellishment.
Where does your interest in the objectification of the human body come from?The human body is the smallest room you as an individual has to deal with. This room is set in the space around you.

I choose the present and the absent of the body because i think this is one of the most changing and stabile topics at the same time in our society at the same time.
What have you been up to in quarantine?I was very concentrated in working in my studio and preparing everything for the next exhibitions.

You work with different mediums including photography, video, sculpture and VR. Which medium do you think is the most powerful and gives best voice to your works?The medium is always related to the content of the work, so I’m always trying to find the best medium for the questions i am dealing with. There is not really one medium I prefer, it is a question on process and reflection which leads me to the work as it is in the end.
For the viewer the question is left open, although the motion in the work is particularly unsettling.

To put it in pathetical terms, the forms seem as though “almost completely dehumanized, nothing more than casings, as though soot-blackened or doused in pitch—hunted, marked by fate, wounded, despairing.” The extracted and cut-out-looking forms emerge entirely through sidelighting. The theme of living together appears in some pictures in the group, particularly in the enigmatic interaction of hands.
What advice would you give to young women wanting to make a career as an artist?I would advise to every young person, to work hard, concentrate on the work and questioning yourself what is worth to be an art work in terms of content and intention. See as much art as possible and reflect the world you are living in.
Louisa Clement’s artistic education was primarily as a photographer, but her activity has not been confined to classical photography, at least not since she created her mirror objects in 2015. In this analysis of individual groups of photographic works, I shall seek to show how the artist has exhausted a limited, medium-specific concept of the two-dimensional photograph, and at times transformed it, and how this is the almost inevitable upshot of the contemporary sociopolitical questioning that her approach involves.
In 2015 you graduated at Kunstakademie Düsserldorf as a master student of Andreas Gursky. What is the most important thing you learnt from him?Gursky teached me to find my own way as an artist, to deal with the point of time and questioning the relevant of the topics I was dealing with, what is it worth to be an art piece?

I would love to invite you to my opening and exhibition "Des Taenzers Weg der Seele", Friday 15 September at WENTRUP Gallery in Berlin. Perhaps you are around these days or the next week.

First of all I have to say that I was very happy about the invitation from you to be part of the show. I like your project very much!
This will involve interaction and communication with artificial humans. And this interaction will occur not physically but in a visual, even a virtual, space where artificial intelligence will help the robot to become a true counterpart. Louisa Clement’s art does not reflect this reality, for it is no longer clear which reality it is that we are living in. Will this altered reality go hand in hand with a change in the idea of what is human?
One of my biggest topics is robotic and AI. my first point for the piece I am planning now was a theory of some futuristics, they are dealing with the thesis that 2045 the human being doesn't need the human body anymore to be alive, which I think is not really possible, because of feelings and experience.
In what way would you say your work discusses identity and humanity?I am discussing where human beings find their self in the digital and real world. Today it is obvious that the digital realm changes our way of dealing with each other, in both positive and negative ways. Identity and Humanity are two quite contested frames. They are explored, also in an artistic manner. To me, as an artist, it is important to include a contemporary feeling of these terms in my work.
A small group is good to talk about things and it is easier for them to ask questions i guess.My plan would be to first visit the exhibition and tell a little bit about the Becher school, from the beginning to now, will be a little history but i think that is important to know and to understand the development of the Becher school and the next generation which I am a part of.
A new sculptural work is part of the show Area Caproni u8opia. Do you want to tell us more about this sculpture in particular?The new sculptures came from an artistic research about the borders of human relationships now a days what changed during the last years and how are we integrate artificiality and absence in our way of thinking, treating and interacting. That leads me to sex dolls and the question of an image your counterpart has to fit in. I was interested in the line between imagination and reality. What kind of image you fill in a person, how big is the part of imagination? I saw the border in the production moulds of sex dolls, these edge between the part where the material for the body will be filled in and the frame which holds the two mould together. These Edge is for me that line.
In Not Lost in You, how did you choose the special pattern clothes for those moving bodies to wear?Since there is a performative act in the video series not lost in you and one person acts with the avatar, but I consider the basic feeling and question of the work to be something general that everyone knows, I also wanted to abstract and generalize the human body from the person acting in the video, to achieve this I chose the ornamental Nylon fabrics.
Where will our society be going when we are completely digital? In a series like heads, this is the question that Louisa Clement asks of us as viewers.
Long's “sculptures“ are made visible in nature through a plot process, through the physical employment of walking a route. The day- and week-long walks in England, in Ireland, in the Alps, the Himalayas or in the deserts of Africa and Australia which followed his first line everywhere in the world, manifest themselves as artistic exploration and document the physical presence and individual time-and-space-experience of the artist. For the artist, the more “human“ aspect of the work is made visible by the temporary arrangement of stones, as the limited presence hints at the reality and transcience of human life. Sculptures, installations, and since 1981 also wall works are created which are not placed in the exterior, but through their materiality and arrangement are still connected to the mentioned landmarks.
Recently I preparing my first virtual reality project, which is related to the black mannequin photographs i did last year. The plan is to meet one of them in a virtual space. Through an AI-Algorihim the mannequin will start to talk to you, it gets his information from the internet, so it can ask and answer question it will be quite close to a normal conversation. The clue is that the mannequin is connected to two algorithms, one of them is programmed to lie. though an random function you never know when it is lying and when it is the thought. gesture and body reactions are connected to the vr glasses so directly to the observers eyes.

Because of its totality, the absence of bodies (literally meaning the non-presence of human individuals), for example in the photographic series on one’s way (2013), is very clearly an important theme in Clement’s work. In the skillful artistic presentation of this absence of human individuals can be seen one of Louisa’s work great strengths.
