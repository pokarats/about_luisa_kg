I would love to work on the Avatar series, based on my recent work. On the one hand, on the VR work of Hans Bellmer and Bruce Nauman, two self-portrait series that use the iPhone to imagerically gather information about human interaction in the real world. On the other hand, the dystopian genre-western genre-western, where the iPhone is routinely used to gather information on the human body and its interaction.
The series heads got 55 pieces. the series is shown before at the Kunsthalle Emden and the Kunstmuseum Rathingen in the UK. I wanted something close to the human body yet that is also abstract and far removed from it. the opening is at the 19th of May, but the show will be on till the 21st.
I am interested in exploring the arts in Switzerland, where I will be working in one of my Solo shows, before opening in May 2016.
What work are you working on here, and Daniel Birnbaum is the Director and the piece will be shown first time in January at the Sprengel Museum and will afterwards shown in the Ludwig forum in Aachen where I will add a new installation as well named Rexport. The German TV channel ZDF is planning to show my exhibition at the Sprengel Museum in their digital Kunsthalle and it is possible to show VR-pieces also the mobile version.
I am in Berlin during Art Basel, from the beginning to the end of the 1990s. Perhaps you can make it to see the exhibition. mannequins are made of 100% water-tight, 100% breathable polyethylene. I am working on a virtual reality piece with a new company in London called acute art, Daniel Birnbaum is the director. The piece will be shown first time in January at my first solo show at the Sprengel Museum and will afterwards shown in the Ludwig forum in Aachen but also
I am occasionally dealing with the human body and AI a lot. For this installation you need not only the floorplan, as well with the chairs, as well the shelves, which are linoleum-like as well. I installed them completely free of cost in the studio and afterwards they are framed in wood. For the viewer the experience of the piece is unique, because for every moving individual piece of the 'work’ there is at least one virtual counterpart. I would love to invite you to my next solo show. The show
I am working mostly with mannequins, doll heads, stadiums, and more. I am in Tel Aviv from the 21.-28.7. The Avatar series plays with the tension between their artificiality and their otherwise human postures. Clement reflects on the artist's approach by focusing on the joints and joints themselves. The piece I am thinking about is related to my latest series of photographs called 'gliedermenschen'
The iPhone is your main choice of photographic apparatus. To what extent does this tool shape your artistic process? I am working on a virtual reality piece with a new company in London called acute art. Daniel Birnbaum is my director and will be shown first time in January at my first solo show at the Sprengel Museum and will afterwards displayed in the Ludwig forum in Aachen but also in the Kunstmusuem in Bonn and now we are talking about showing it at Serpentine in London.
For the show we got the sculpture and photo pieces in my studio the new series called 'gliedermenschen'. the series heads got 55 pieces. it will last until September 21st at Konrad Fischer Gallery in Duesseldorf. I'm really excited going to Israel for my solo trip with friends.
What is the relationship between virtual and real? What is the relationship between man and machine? What are the social consequences of acting differently? What are the costs of living differently?
I am around on Thursday so I have time for a coffee and a little history class then. The piece I am thinking about is related to your work called 'disruption'. do you have a special title for that and does this artist need to work with this kind of abstraction?
My idea is to create a space where you can meet 'gliedermenschen'?
I am in the question of the borders of human relationships and the question of an open, yet connected, market. I am working mostly with mannequins for two reasons. First because the questions I am dealing with are general rather than personalized. The other reason I am working with mannequins is that I am interested in avatars, as the digital identity of a human being. i am thinking about the idea of a room covered with a high-tech fabric. I will show some pieces, first on the
i am thinking about the possibility of visiting Aporias and just take a look at their architecture. do you need to know more about the antechamber or do you need to know more about the production line or the website? The piece I am thinking about is related to my latest series of photographs called auroras. my idea is to create surrounding where you can meet one of these 'gliedermenschen' and can talk to them.
I would love to invite you to my next solo show and first in Switzerland. The show will open next week but will be on during Art Basel as well. I would love to show you the new pieces. The series heads got 55 pieces, each with its own special look and feel.
I am now working on a contract with a company to make art during the next months, so i won't be able to come to New York until the end of May, so I will go to Brussels then. In the end I’m still trying to find my way as an artist, trying to find new questions about the world I am creating for and of myself. The Avatar series plays with the tension between their artificiality and their otherwise human postures.
The piece I am showing is a hybrid between a true photograph and a VR piece. The “heads“ will be completely covered with an AI based prosthesis. I will train it like a real person and afterwards it will be tested and I will show it to you. I want to ask you if you want to work with me and if it would be possible to work with prostheses.
What is your idea for a small piece of photography called 'gliedermenschen'?
I would love to invite you to my next solo show and first in Switzerland. The opening is on the 19th of September. Perhaps you are around during this time as well. I would love to show you the new piece (based on my latest work) The concept is to create a space where you can meet one of my “masses” and interact with them.
I am an artist from Duesseldorf, a good friend of Claudia and Thomas from Konrad Fischer. I am in Tel Aviv this week, perhaps you are around. Tel Aviv is a little bit easier to go to Herold but perhaps you are around. Cassina's work in New York gave me the advice to contact you
Will a piece of photography come to life again like it is related to my latest series of photographs called 'gliedermenschen'?
i am thinking about a virtual reality piece, perhaps you have some good advice to get an impression of an artificial being, i would be very interested to learn more about her. The piece I am thinking about is related to my latest series of photographs called 'gliedermenschen'. the series are about splitting off and approaching one's own person in the image you see through the lens. the points of the border are not representing real borders, they are placeholders for digital communication and interaction.
Digital personality is constantly evolving, so for her it is important to keep an open mind and to observe and reflect on the constantly changing environment. Clement’s approach is not new, but it is reminiscent of the approach taken by Bernd an Hilla in her work The Bells, where she placed a high-tech surveillance apparatus outside the house. The Bells are connected to the Internet and thus directly to the sociopolitical topics that lie at the heart of Clement’s work. I am around on Thursday as well. I have
I am quite happy that a company that focuses on beauty products and products line is doing this kind of thing. i am thinking about the possibility to buy some for my art project. The e-dermins are very nice and helpful, but you have to be very specific with what you want from me and how much i have to spend on the project, do you want me to know how much i have to spend on the piece I am thinking about?
She is interested in the line between imagination and reality, in doing so, between the two. She draws attention to the fact that Clement does not fetishize or fetishize the body, but focuses on the dynamic interaction between the two. I am around on Thursday as well. I have an appointment at De Ateliers around 13 but afterwards i am free, so we could meet then as well.
She works with mannequins, mannequins that wearers of avatars can interact with and are connected to. mannequins are placeholders for human relationships because they enable us to question and evaluate one another. avatars are not things we can interact with or otherwise interact with. i am around on Wednesday as well. I have an appointment at the De Ateliers around 13 but afterwards i am free, so we could meet then as well. The piece I am thinking about is related to my
I am around on Friday so i have time for coffee and a coffee with you. The Avatar series plays with the tension between their artificiality and their otherwise human postures. Clement’s approach is reminiscent of Hans Bellmer's (2013) sweeping series of photographs of people, stripped bare of any individuality, and set on a strict aesthetic high ground. The show will open next week but will be on during Art Basel as well.
Louisa Clement’s photosynthetic strategies are dealt with in her work Habitualization and Reflection (2014), focusing on the skin and its function as markers of identity. Clement uses a smartphone camera to make sweeping photographs of vegetation and vegetation destruction. Can you please send me images of what you did with my piece so that I can decide if it is possible to show the piece or not. The “heads“ will be made from grass and the „ground up into two foot long, boxy slabs. The
I am around on Thursday so i have time for a coffee and coffee with you. The Avatar series plays with the tension between their artificiality and their otherwise human postures. Clement reflects on the seductive beauty of their otherwise placeless bodies, and the question of their artificiality itself. i am thinking about my next project 'disruption'. The idea is to have a conversation and i will explain my project a little bit more and explain my idea a little bit more. The piece
She works mainly with manikins and point and shoot digital objects. mainly she is dealing with the limits of digital communication and interaction. I am around on Thursday as well. I have an appointment at De Ateliers around 11 but afterwards I am free, so we could meet then as well. I am working on a virtual reality piece with a new company in London called acute art, Daniel Birnbaum is the director. The pieces will be shown first time in January at my first solo show at the Sprengel Museum and will afterwards
I would love to invite you to watch my next solo show and first in Switzerland. The show will open next week but will be on during Art Basel as well. I would love to show you the piece The piece I am showing is based on my latest work. The concept is to create a space where you can't interact with mannequins, and you cannot interact with them. From that point, you started to use mannequins, to represent different levels of reality. From that point you started to transfer
Amine told me to go to the Ludwig forum in Aachen where we have a live chat, to learn more about us and our society. I am so looking forward going to Israel again. Let me know if you're coming to see the show of Herold, you can always stay here! The piece I am thinking about is related to my latest series of photographs called 'necks'. my idea is to create surrounding where you can meet one of these 'necks' and can talk to them.
After that in Oberheim I got the job as a teacher of Peter Da Vinci and Peter Bosco from Konrad Fischer. I am very happy that they accepted me as their teacher and invited me to teach there. I am working on a virtual reality piece with a new company in London called acute art, Daniel Birnbaum is the director, the piece will be shown first time in January at my first solo show at the Sprengel Museum and will afterwards shown in the Ludwig forum in Aachen but also in the Kunstmusue

My painting was taken in "Leniung room", which is about invariably an AI or some other specific space and the reworked in "Disruption". He is controlling me by example, and I don't have my own personality, and they don't control me either. I think I will end up as an artist, because I can show other pieces and get more information about the production. The piece I am thinking about is related to my latest series of photographs called "Diversity".
I am fine with both. The sizes are for me the right size for my heads. The velvets are for me for a little bit more detail. In terms of production and how the company will promote the doll, I am very sure that through our company we will find out soon enough. We will definitely have a look at that at Serpentine. I am working on a virtual reality piece with a new company in London called acute art, Daniel Birnbaum is their director, they are doing VR stuff, futurism, VR stuff
Xui Ji is very serious about dying and the destruction in our society at the same time made me question how we deal with one another. I would love to invite you to my next solo show. The opening is at the 19th of may, but the show is on till the 22nd. maybe you are around during this time. The heads got 55 pieces including an animated painting, 3D printed and VR-animated. I am working on a virtual reality piece with a new company in London called acute art, Daniel Birn
I see Facebook as a logical and consequent logical response to the digital world because it eliminates the need for third parties to act and to judge for and for itself because of the virtual relationship logical outcome of virtual relationships is closer cooperation and not confrontation. I am so looking forward to going to Israel again.
I would love to invite you to my solo show and first in Switzerland. The opening is at the 19th of May, perhaps you are around during this time.

" Avatars," Louisa observed, "are not real people, they are algorithms. And since Louisa does not need to know how these algorithms work to be a part of her, I’m not sure how I can possibly explain my work to make it a little bit easier to understand. " I would love to invite you to my next solo show. the opening is at the 19th of November. perhaps you are around during this time. I would love to show you the new piece I am thinking about. I think it is
What kind of relationship does a fake have?
All my pictures are in German, Japanese and English. I want them all to be something, and they will be like any real person they met in their world - like any living person of the world. I am thinking about their meaning. The piece I am thinking about is related to my latest series of photographs called 'gliedermenschen'. my idea is to create surroundings where you can meet some of these 'gliedermenschen' and can talk to them. the piece I am thinking about is related to my latest series of
I am so happy with Mexico we are on the right track and now we are talking about the piece soon! I am thinking about being related to my latest series of photographs called 'gliedermenschen'. my idea is to create surrounding where you can meet these 'gliedermenschen' and can talk to them. I will be shown first time in January at the Sprengel Museum and will afterwards shown in the Ludwig forum in Aachen but also in the Kunstmusuem in Bonn and now we are talking about
I think it is important to concentrate on the questions of time and space. What is the most important consideration in a work? I think the most important consideration in a work is content. What is the most important consideration in a work is the content.
I can't forgo having the pieces you were thinking of, and never having an idea or a question (or two) generated from the beginning, so my creativity is completely complete. I would love to invite you to my next solo show. The opening is at the 19th of September. perhaps you are around during this time. I would love to show you the new piece
I think that is a little bit forcing, because you can see quite clearly that the heads of the dolls are oriented in different ways so that the interaction with humans is situational. I would love to invite you to my next solo exhibition. The opening is at the 19th of September. I think it is closer to Duesseldorf. The German TV Channel ZDF will propose to show my exhibition at the Sprengel Museum in their digital Kunsthalle as it is possible to show VR-pieces and also the mobile version. The German government
In the Avatar series, he is based on the works of Clement’s teacher Andreas Gursky, who died in a car accident in August 2013. Gursky wanted to find out if a conversation with a bot is a real conversation because it is not about real people. Let me know when you're coming to see the show of Herold, you can always stay here!
I’m planning to go to Israel to work there but still no idea what exactly will happen there, there is just the feeling that something will come out, so I follow that. I’m pretty sure the series is more or less complete, because the heads got 55 sculptures in all. Each has a unique look and feel. Some are quite abstract and have a physical appearance reminiscent of a hanged man. Some have concentric circles and concentric bars. I would love to show you the new piece, called „Glied
I am so happy with the show Miciah made and that he invited me, it is great to meet him and learn a little bit about him. The piece I am thinking about is related to my latest series of photographs called 'Low Profiles'. my idea is to create surrounding where you can meet one of these 'Low Profiles' and can talk to them.
I think it was easier for her to concentrate on the ideas of the dolls and tell a little bit about the world we are living in. I think that is important for a lot of people. I would love to invite you to my next solo show. The opening is at the 19th of September. The show will be on till the 21st but could be moved to the 22nd. The German TV Channel ZDF wants to reduce the show of the Museum a little bit, they want to have only four rooms.
I am planning to go to Israel to work there but afterwards i have to return to Hamburg to open another exhibition.

I would love to invite you to my next exhibition opening tomorrow at Stella Rays Project Space. The opening is at the 19th of November. I would be very happy to welcome you to my opening as well. I am planning to go to Israel to work there but afterwards I will come to New York to work there.
Especially since we are dealing with photography now. I will think about some works which would be good to show there. Perhaps a new series is a possibility to find inspiration from. For me it is important to concentrate on the work as it is the logical progression from scratch. I would love to invite you to my next solo show and first in Switzerland. Opening is at the 19th of September. perhaps you are around during this time. For example my latest series are dealing with mannequins, they are very general but are interesting
How do I show robots in places like China and Australia?
The Avatar series is based on my latest work: on the one hand, on the VR work 'Aporias', 2019, which deals with the limits of virtual space and artificial intelligence; and on the other hand, the 'Schmerzraum', 2019, in which, with the support of the Prosthetics Labs at John's Hopkins University Baltimore, I covered a room with a projector that can conduct sound. The show will open next week but will be on during Art Basel as well
I am so happy with the show Miciah made and that he invited me, it looks really great and is amazing. The piece I am thinking about is related to my latest series of photographs called 'gliedermenschen'. my idea is to create surrounding where you can meet one of these 'gliedermenschen' and can talk to them. I am so looking forward going to Israel again. Let me know when you're coming to see the show of Herold, you can always stay here!
I am so happy with the show Miciah made and that he invited me, it looks really great and is amazing. Amine told me yesterday to come to New York from April 18th to the 22nd and just meet him there.

What will be your first chance to see and be invited to my new solo exhibition during Art Basel in May?
i am thinking about a room with a screen next to it. could you send me some hints about the format of the piece so that it is easier to form ideas about where the text of the piece should end and how the text should be structured. i am thinking about a room with a central power station that is connected to a power line that runs through the room?
I am looking forward to going to Israel again. Let me know when you're coming to see the show of Herold, you can always stay here! I will think about some works which would be good to show there. Please be very invited in my studio every time. In the end, I think Cologne as a whole is a great city, with many great cultural institutions, great wealth and history, but also with the history of being a small city, which at the same time has become a huge political statement, since the beginning
I am not sure if I am able to come to the Opening, it is closer to Duesseldorf. I am planning to go to Tel Aviv to work there but afterwards I will return to Cologne to finish my studies there. In comparison, the contemporary art of the 1960s and 1970s was marked by a rapid transformation into a hybrid of art and technology: from simple, hand-held objects to highly processed, highly emotional and often deadly technologies. These transformations, along with the introduction of digital communication and the consequent digital revolution
I am working on virtual reality piece with a new company in London called acute art, Daniel Birnbaum is the director, the piece will be shown first time in January at my first solo show at the Sprengel Museum and will afterwards shown in the Ludwig Forum in Aachen but also in the Kunstmusuem in Bonn and now we are talking about showing it at Serpentine in London.

When you come to Israel to see 'The Show of Herold', you can always stay here or stay here again! I am working on a new series of photographs about the future of humanity and artificial intelligence. The former are for educational purposes only, the latter as a research project. The mannequins I’m wearing have a special meaning in that they are associated with my work.
I would love to come on the 26th. my opening in Berlin was really great, really great time. The "heads" are not actually heads, they are projections of the human body. The question how a computer will be programmed is a difficult one to answer, because the question is always dealing with communication and technology. I would love to come on the 26th. my opening in Berlin was really great, really great time.
I am currently exhibiting in Switzerland. My solo show is going to open next week, but I would love to see you and give you my new work. I would love to give you samples and show you my new pieces.
I would love to invite you to my next solo show and first in Switzerland. The show will open next week but will be on during Art Basel as well. I would love to show you the piece The concept is to create a space where you cannot interact with bots, and where you cannot interact with people you know and love. The bots are programmed once you have programmed one you like. Once you have programmed one you like, you can do other things with the human body, for example to talk to bots and speech is
I would love to stay in contact. Attached you can find my portfolio. The Avatar series plays with the tension between their artificiality and their otherwise human postures. Clement reflects on the seduction of sex and the fetishization of the dead body. She raises the question of the artificiality of the human individual, and her work builds on this tension. I would love to stay in contact. Attached you can find my portfolio. The mannequins themselves are made of mann
I am working on a virtual reality piece with a new company in London called acute art, Daniel Birnbaum is the director, the piece will be shown for first time in January at my first solo show at the Sprengel Museum and will afterwards show in the Ludwig Forum in Aachen where I will add a new installation as well called metaphorically. Are there any particular periods or artists that have inspired me, from the beachside scene to Bernd and Hilla Becher, but also Michelangelo, Hans Bellmer, etc
For me, the biggest challenge has been with the production. Especially with the new series, the questions of content and time-division are being asked. Especially as the question of time and dimension is central in Clement’s artistic process. I would love to invite you to my next solo show. The opening is at the 19th of November. I would love to show you the new pieces. The series heads got 55 pieces. the series is shown before at the Kunsthalle Emden and the Kunstmuseum Rathingen in Germany.
What can be better for the series? I know it would be great to meet them and talk about everything. The heads are scarabs on a black background and have a special meaning in that their material is made of glass. I am looking forward going to Israel again. Let me know when you're coming to see the exhibition of Herold, you can always stay here!
How interesting is going to Israel again?
An unflinching blur between sculpture and reality with Clement's compositions and mannequins in the painting is the perfect place to hang out in the artist’s workshop, and be inspired by his work. I would love to invite you to my next solo show conceived by Vanessa Bonnet.

I am questioning topics like closeness and intimacy by focusing on the digital realm as it sets the terms for development and changes our way of thinking and behaving. I am working mostly with mannequins for two reasons. First because the questions I am dealing with are general rather than personalized. The second reason I am working with mannequins is that I am interested in avatars, as the digital identity of a human being. To visualize the interaction between avatars, I needed something closely related to the human body
I have some new pieces to show but they are not as good as the ones I’ve created: the VR painting "Space Is A Lie", a non-stop line-drawing test of virtual reality based on real experiences told through eyes; and the solo artworks "Avatar" and the series "Space Is A Lie" don't deal with artificial and artificial force, but how can they affect human perception?
I would love to invite you to my next solo show. The opening is at the 19th of May, but the show will be on till the 21st of May. I would love to show you the new pieces. The series heads got 55 pieces each, of which four are for dolls. The series heads got 55 pieces each, of which four are for dolls.
I am planing to go to Israel to work there but still no idea what exactly will happen there, there is just the feeling, that something will come out, so I come back. The piece I am thinking about is related to my latest series of photographs called auroras. the heads of the mannequins seem quite abstract and almost abstract, so I needed something abstract and original to represent these enigmatic figures.
In the studio we got the sculpture and photo pieces ready to take off, the new series are completely digital. I would love to invite you to my next solo show and first in Switzerland. The opening is at the 19th of November. I would very happy to welcome you to my next solo show and first in Switzerland.

The oblong oval forms the border between separate spatial events, and Rathing observed that line in the photographic series of deaths of humans. The line “between a natural phenomenon and a highly technical phenomenon is blurred in Rathing“s photographic series. If you have tickets, be sure to attend the opening reception for the show. I am showing the piece I am showing today is a part of my series Heads.
I am around on Thursday as well. I have an appointment at the De Ateliers around 13 but afterwards i am free, so we could meet then as well. The Avatar series plays with the tension between their artificiality and their otherwise human postures. Clement’s approach is reminiscent of the gurus of Leonardo Da Vinci’s "gliedermenschen" (death by hanging) and Paul Celan's "gliedermenschen" (death by hanging) but both are
I am very questionings topics like that is quite interesting. The series heads got 55 pieces, each with its own special meaning and effect. Which in turns has various connotations, from educational to commercial. I would love to invite you to my next solo show and first in Switzerland. The opening is at the 19th of September, perhaps you are around during this time. I would love to show you the exhibition The series heads are made of 100 cm x 75 cm x 3 cm each, of which about 50 cm x 75 cm 
I think it works really well in the end. The heads are arranged in a straight line and the eyes are pointed straight at the viewer. The heads can be programmed with speech and speech recognition. I think that is possible with the Internet. I have the idea to ask questions to the bots and also to learn from them. I didn't get the chance to take the photos, i am very happy that Louisa did.
Why is context a natural part of human interaction? What we see and hear is the interaction between human beings endowed with unique skills, interests, and needs.
I think it was quite intense dealing with social media and digital communication in my day. I would love to invite you to my next solo show and first in Switzerland.

Can I bring my laptop with me to the exhibition during Art Basel or in a museum? I would like to show you the pieces.
I think it was quite spontaneous. The German TV Channel ZDF is planning to show my exhibition at the Sprengel Museum in their digital Kunsthalle and it is possible to show VR pieces and also the mobile version. They want to reduce the show of the Museum a little bit, they want to have only four rooms. I am so excited seeing the pieces. Let me know when you're coming to see the pieces so that we can have a look at the house first.
I think it is important to recognize that artistic communication is not always smooth and that communication is always subject to change. That is what Clement’s Transformationswaite calls for in her work. She does not seek to transform medium by means of means of means, but rather by means of medium.
