do you have anything what is missing for you or something we should leave out?

# too personal info
I hope you had a save journey back to Ghent on Friday. I was a little bit hungover on Saturday :-) great evening, very funny. 
Perhaps we find an evening for a gin tonic then???
At the opening he was ill so we are planning a dinner during the next weeks, will be fun i am sure about! he is super nice.
Thank you so much for helping with my baggage, complete disaster .. since 4 days without suitcase ...
But I asked Maria three times for the photos that I can decide what happens with the pieces. No answer from her. That is absolutely not ok. She is not allowed to bring my piece to the framer without my agreement. That is absolutely not the way how things like that should go. Aside of that she printed the card with my picture without credits or even showing me the card, which is not ok as well. At least you have to talk about things like that with the artist. My question about the date of the opening ( i actually wanted to come to the opening) and the title of the exhibition wasn't answered, I got that later from the invitation card. I am sorry, but that is not how you work together. And I am very sorry, i am and was working with some galleries smaller and bigger ones but something like that never happens to me and at the moment I don't see how I can part of the exhibition. I hope you understand my problem with this situation.
Thank you!! I really like the show! I didn't meet Tamir but we are in contact I think I will see her next time then.
I hope you had a good time in Berlin it was nice to meet you there again.
please don\u2019t mind, i know how crazy gallery weekend can be. 
, do you know them? i\u2019ll let you know the exact days directly when i have booked.
I\u2018m planing to go to San Francisco for a project so I could stop by in New York then.

Yes is was very nice, is it possible that you come a little bit earlier, at 11. my next show I am as little bit crazy and tomorrow will be the last thing to solve and eventually I have to go to Basel tomorrow evening. Would that be possible?
# some unrelated news in the end of the email
It was such a great time in Israel, I already booked to come back in October.
Tomorrow there is a vip breakfast in my exhibition at the Kunstraum Riehen next to the Beyeler foundation, I am very spontaneously allowed to invite people by myself, so I would love to invite you to this breakfast at 9:30.
Yes it was a great meeting on Monday! I am so excited about the project!! Looking forward hearing from you and of course working on our project."
Tomorrow is perfect, i have a meeting at 10 but afterwards I am free, any time is good for me.
I am free in half an hour, would that fit for you?",
yes i am very well, i was in Washington with the foreign minister this week, just for 22 hours but is was really funny :-)"
great, i will produce them, when do you need them to be ready?
Can we talk tomorrow? I am sitting in a train since two hours, it stops because of a police operation ....any time would be good for me tomorrow.
Would it be possible to meet at 2pm tomorrow as well, I just then will have a little more time."
i hope you had a great Christmas and now a great start in 2019. All the best for this year.
D\u00fcsseldorf was nice, how was it for you, went everything well? the piece Jean and Marina took is: Avatar 30 2016 Inkjetprint

The week was great, really good opening!!! We can catch up tomorrow anytime or on Thursday, what would be better for you?
I hope you are well and in New York the spring is coming now :) For the Easter holidays I will come to New York from April 15th to the 22nd and just wonder if you are around and have time for a coffee? Would be great to see you!

I will be in London from the 15th to the 17th if we are thinking about doing an interview or something I Thank you, yes would be great to meet, I\u2019ll let you know when I am in Berlin, should be in Februarycould come by.
Yes lets text on Tuesday next week that is great. I talked to Georg the other day and we thought about doing the show together, perhaps this is an idea we could talk about.
If you have any questions, please ask
I have a question, do you have any information about the gallery in Bilbao? I still have trouble with them because of the damaged pieces of last year, now you cannot reach them anymore. Do you have any information.
the avatar 29 is in my studio ;-) the other one is already in the gallery right? i am mostly around the next weeks so transport can be anytime!!!!"
Great. Yes with the framer everything will be fine. I will connect you with the framer some days before the fair that you can explain where to go on the fair.
Yes I am in Berlin in the 24th until lunch? Can we meet in the morning? Tuesday is also good for me, the earliest would be 11, I am the whole day free. Perfect, looking forward meeting you tomorrow!
I am really sad to say that i am not allowed to leave the delegation, because of safety reasons :-/ so i cannot come over to Baltimore, but i am thinking about coming in the end of November, because i really want to see the lab and what are you doing.
It would be amazing if you could talk to your group and send me a flat sensor of 1 x1 m. Do you need some kind of guarantee that i just use it for this art piece? to me this way of thinking about the body and pain is very important for my work. the material arrived, i was the week not in the studio so i just saw it today!!! no i will start thinking about what to do, i\'ll let you know about the steps, i am so exhibited what will happen.
Thank you for the day, it was great and I am so looking for the piece! I will sent you footage asap! It is perfect when you make a press package.For Art Basel i\'ll let you know when we are clear with them should be next month.
I can send the works to my gallery in Berlin so you can pick them up there. this would be Wentrup gallery. if that is ok for you i choose 6 of the heads, sent them to the gallery and put you in contact with them?
the project sound very interesting and i would be happy to be part of it. the series heads got 55 pieces how many of them do you need? the series is shown before at the Kunsthalle Emden and the Kunstmuseum Rathingen in Germany so i 
the footage is coming, sorry that is takes so long. i thought about having some footage of the installation of the show in Hannover as well, in the studio it is more or less sitting on the computer the show could be more interesting what do you think? Did you have contact with the museum because of the installation of the piece. are you sending the equipment directly to the museum and do i have to know anything for the installation. i am so exhibited to see the piece there.
i will check this today i am already on my way to Hannover, do you know if anything is ok with the equipment for the museum? i did\'t hear something from Irene. Sorry to bother you again but I really need to know how and when we install the piece next week. Can you please tell me when we can do that? Monday is press conference at 11 and Tuesday is the opening in the evening :)




# piece from the email
I just wonder as you have contact to Google if you could connect me to a person who knows about the company.
then I found your amazing paper and this was absolutely groundbreaking to me, because the material is body and not body and can feel. 

#maybe to add seperately because thy are good general expressions
i am quite bad putting myself in the context.
